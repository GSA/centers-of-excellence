## Our Values:

* **Know our customer.** Understanding and anticipating the needs of our customers is our highest priority. Speaking with our customers and regularly gathering their insights allows agencies to rethink the way they deliver technology solutions today.

* **Innovate from within.** Technical talent exists across government. We strive to identify innovators and harness their experiences.

* **Collaborate for success.** We recruit the best and brightest from our customers' workforces to co-lead modernization efforts and ensure success and longevity beyond CoE engagements.

* **Rely on best practices.** We also partner with the private sector to implement the latest technology, utilize commercial practices, accelerate modernization and avoid common pitfalls.

* **Centralize our resources.** We strive to centralize and share the brightest talent, proven processes and acquisition vehicles to yield the best results across government.
