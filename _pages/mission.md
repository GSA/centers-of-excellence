* **Innovate from within** - There is a lot of great technical talent across the government, we strive to identify those innovators and harness their experience in the CoEs.

* **Collaborate for success** - The CoEs recruit the best and brightest from our customer’s workforce to co-lead modernization efforts and ensure success and longevity beyond CoE engagements.

* **Rely on best practices** - We also partner with the private sector to implement the latest technology, utilize commercial practices, accelerate modernization and avoid common pitfalls.

* **Centralize our resources** - By standing up the Centers of Excellence we strive to centralize and share the brightest talent, proven processes and acquisition vehicles to yield the best results across government.
