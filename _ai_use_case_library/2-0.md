title: "AI Use Case: Change Detection on Train Tracks"
---
The safety of railroad tracks is of critical importance to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and a new tool that uses 3-dimensional imaging to identify changes to the tracks can help keep the tracks safe.
{: .intro }

FRA at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is always looking for solutions to make rail travel and transport safer and more efficient. But track inspection is challenging due to the high number of components and systems. When the vendor-developed smart optical system was identified, the agency decided to test whether scanning trackbeds and detecting change using artificial intelligence (AI) provided a good supplement to human inspection.

The FRA partnered with the vendor that had developed a 3-dimensional imaging system that could be deployed on railcars to detect changes in the state of the tracks. **Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the images at two points in time, the FRA can now detect changes that might impact the safe use of the tracks and plan for needed maintenance.**

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are commonly used to analyze visual imagery. CNN is a deep learning technique to input an image, assign importance to various characteristics of the image, and surface differences among images or between an image and a set of criteria.

## Background
Roughly 140,000 miles of train track covers the U.S. To keep the track in safe working order, it is regularly inspected for changes â€” with inspectors considering every aspect of the track and every standard. This is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, and the human eye cannot possibly see every potential defect. 

By using a smart optical system in addition to human inspection, railroads may be able to ensure safer train travel.
