Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the computational techniques that simulate human cognitive capabilities. AI will transform most, if not every aspect of humanity, which presents a range of challenges and opportunities. 
{: .intro }

AI has already revolutionized the business world. Its application across the federal government is fundamentally changing the way agencies meet their mission. **The U.S. government must embrace these opportunities head-on to remain on the leading edge and stay competitive.**

This AI Use Case Library is intended to help government decision makers clearly see what AI means for their agencies and how to invest and build AI capabilities.
{: .ai-ucl-feature }

Because AI is such a broad term to describe new and emerging applications, we’ve broken the AI Use Case Library into different chapters. At this time, the Guide does not include technical sections.
