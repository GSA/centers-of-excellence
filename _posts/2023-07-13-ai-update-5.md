Last April, the AI Community of Practice (AI CoP) launched the first [Applied AI Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=applied-ai-challenge), followed by the [Applied AI Healthcare Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=applied-ai-healthcare-challenge&tab=timeline) in February of this year. With a combined 175 participant submissions from private and public sectors, these challenges have proved how increased public engagement can advance the impact of technology in government. The goal of these prize competitions is to help federal agencies understand and adopt AI and related technologies to better serve the American public. 

Continuing on these successes, the AI CoP has launched the **[Applied AI Challenge: Large Language Models (LLM)](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=appliedaichallengellms)**. 

<h2>About the Challenge</h2>
This challenge intends to help agencies understand the risks and benefits of emerging LLM technologies. This goal is achievable through a broad and open challenge encouraging LLM solutions for use in the federal government that are in accordance with [Executive Order (EO) 13960](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/08/2020-27065/promoting-the-use-of-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-federal-government). 

Per the EO, “It is the policy of the United States to promote the innovation and use of AI, where appropriate, to improve Government operations and services in a manner that fosters public trust, builds confidence in AI, protects our Nation's values, and remains consistent with all applicable laws, including those related to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.”  

Specifically, the Applied AI LLM Challenge encourages applicants to focus submissions on the following four priority areas derived from President's Management Agenda and the Biden-Harris Administration Immediate Priorities: 
- **Climate:** Tackling the climate crisis.
- **Equity:** Enabling every American an equal chance to get ahead.
- **Economy:** Promoting a strong and resilient economy.
- **Customer Experience:** Providing a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience across federal government services and platforms.

Participants will compete for four $25,000 prizes. Large and small enterprises, women-owned, minority-owned, small disadvantaged, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.

<h2>Key Dates </h2>
- **Open for submissions:** June 30, 2023!
- **Deadline to apply:** July 26, 2023.
- **Industry Day:** August 31, 2023 — Open to Federal Employees - 8 finalists to present.
