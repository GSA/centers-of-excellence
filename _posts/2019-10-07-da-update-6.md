**This is the second part of the new Data and Analytics CoE OCDO Series...** 

The General Services Administration’s <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/data-analytics.html">Data & Analytics Center of Excellence (DA CoE)</a> establishes goals for agency’s Data Modernization efforts including increasing data maturity, interoperability, and governance. Evolving the data and analytics maturity at any agency requires a collaborative effort between the agency’s offices and leadership to transform data into a strategic asset for the benefit of customers and the public. The DA CoE are helping establish and stand up <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/2019/06/25/da-update-4.html">Offices of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO)</a>  for partner agencies, which are developed in tandem with data-relevant OMB guidance and newly released legislation. Below are the preliminary steps regarding how the DA CoE works with an agency to prepare for the OCDO to ensure organizational success.

CoE Approach:  A successful OCDO requires formalized organizational alignment and expectations both within the Office and 
across the agency. The official charter should explicitly state the mission, vision, goals, and authorities to formalize 
expectations before the Office is established. In accordance with the mission and funding availability, the charter should 
identify necessary support roles, both technical and business focused. During onboarding of OCDO staff, and the CDO her or 
his-self, an agency will be able to utilize the charter as a means to fully understand the purpose of the OCDO and its 
employees.

CoE Approach: Developing an executable Data Governance Roadmap requires understanding  the current governance landscape and 
an assessment of enterprise-wide business requirements. Agencies should develop this roadmap prior to the establishment of 
the OCDO, providing a path for initial wins and preparing specific projects for the OCDO’s long-term success. Through an 
inclusive, agency-wide, process this gathering of information will contribute to current and future organizational data 
governance priorities. As the priorities emerge and are re-aligned, organizational leadership (through a formally established 
data governance body) should continually evaluate the mission-delivery and business enhancement outcomes these priorities 
will produce and assign resources to them accordingly, ensuring that timeframes and costs are taken into account.
