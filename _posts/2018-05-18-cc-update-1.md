On April 3, 2018, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue launched his second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcwG4iwN6Fk">“Backed to Our Roots”</a> RV Tour across the country.

In support of this tour, the Contact Center CoE, in partnership with USDA’s Office of Communications and Office of Customer Experience, helped launch a single, easy to use web form and an toll-free number that allows the public to provide direct feedback to USDA leadership.

In close collaboration with USDA staff and agency leadership, the CoE developed questions for the web form and contact center script. The CoE created created short-term solution for escalating customer issues and ensuring their inquiries are resolved.  Supporting Tell Sonny gave us important insights into USDA’s internal processes and points of contact for the intake, tracking, and resolving of customer feedback and provides a great preview for our broader CoE work around the Voice of the Customer.
