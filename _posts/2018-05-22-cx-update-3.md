Vrinda Gupta, a CX CoE researcher, conducts a ‘card sort’ activity with a farmer in Hollis, Oklahoma. After an in-depth interview about the farmer’s experience of the direct loan process, card sorting was used to capture which of the proposed solutions would be the most beneficial to improve the direct loan experience for farmers.
