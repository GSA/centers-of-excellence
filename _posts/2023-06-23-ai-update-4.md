On February 9, 2023, The Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (AI CoP), supported by the AI CoE, launched the [Applied AI Healthcare Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=applied-ai-healthcare-challenge).   The challenge intended to assist agencies with the adoption of AI and related technologies to better serve the American people's healthcare system. This goal is achievable through a broad and open challenge encouraging out-of-the-box solutions, along with opportunities for participants to demonstrate a direct application of promising AI technologies. 

<h2>About the Challenge</h2>
We asked industry for solutions that enable federal healthcare service providers and agencies to improve outcomes for the American people. Participants were encouraged to consider how their submitted material addresses AI within the following focus areas:
- **Mental Health:** AI technologies applied to mental health data in identifying potential courses of treatment.
- **Addiction and the Opioid Epidemic:** Enabling public service agencies to identify trends within populations to facilitate early detection and intervention.
- **Equity:** Technologies that improve outcomes for populations disproportionately impacted by illness or disease. 
- **Supply Chain and Safety:** Improve access and safety to medications and supplies for US citizens. 
- **Cancer:** Assisting practitioners in early cancer detection and improving outcomes based on research-based AI detection models.

<h2>Results </h2>
The challenge received a total of 53 vendor submissions addressing a wide range of healthcare topics. Ten finalists were selected to participate in an Industry Day on May 2, 2023. 

Each finalist shared a lightning talk of their concept and prototype. Over 150 federal employees from across 17 government agencies attended to learn about emerging technologies available to further their mission delivery. Clare Martorana, Federal CIO, and Conrad Stosz, Director of AI OFCIO at the White House, opened the event with keynote remarks.

<h2>Challenge Winners</h2>
All submissions were evaluated by a panel of federal AI experts considering clarity, alignment to government missions, potential impact, and feasibility.  

The four selected winners were awarded $25,000 in cash prizes: 

- Predicting Behavioral Emergencies in the Hospital — Duke Institute for Health Innovation
- The Healthy Selfie Digital Biomarker Platform — BioTrillion
- AIDANT: Using AI to Predict Inequity in Underserved Medicaid and Children Health Insurance Program Beneficiaries Under 19 Who are at Risk for Caries and Type 2 Diabetes — DATA DOC, MD LLC
- ProFound AI© Breast Cancer Detection and Personalized Risk Assessment — iCAD, Inc
