<h2><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
Building mature data analytics organizations across government is a necessary step to achieve the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal of leveraging data as a strategic asset that will increase the federal government’s effectiveness, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency.
The Data Analytics Center of Excellence (CoE) drives innovation in data management, analysis and reporting for partner agencies. Its overarching goal is to enable data-driven decision-making.
The team developed this 10-play Playbook so agencies can lead more effective government policies and programs. While not every play will apply to your agency, they will help you strive towards more data-driven decisions.
The Data Analytics CoE developed this Playbook according to relevant laws, policies, and guidance, including the newly released Federal Data Strategy and OMB Circular A-11. The relevant directives provide the fundamental framework by which the CoE conducts discovery and implementation.

<h2><a id="Key Concepts"></a>Key Concepts</h2>
hroughout this document, we will refer to the following key concepts:

- **Advanced Analytics** - Using tools and technologies to predict future trends
(i.e., predictive data analytics, data mining, and artificial intelligence (AI) efforts).
- **Data Culture** - Organizational investment in data analytics capacity; cultivation of an environment where all staff are encouraged to use data to make key decisions.
- **Data Governance** - The practice of data management to ensure high data quality; key focus areas include data availability, usability, integrity, and security.
- **Data Infrastructure** - Collection of technologies (e.g., hardware, software, cloud services) used for data sharing and utilization.
- **Data Visualization** - Using visual elements (e.g., charts or graphs) to quickly consume key information.
- **Technical Infrastructure** - Collection of hardware, software, networks, cloud resources, data centers, etc., used to support information technology (IT) services.

<h2><a id="Play1"></a>Play 1</h2>
Define a clear	and realistic vision of your organization’s near-term	and long-term goals for
data analytics.	You’ll be able to assess the maturity level of your organization’s data analytics.

<h3>Checklist</h3>

- Develop and continue to refine the overarching vision statement and conceptual framework to explain what data analytics could mean to the organization, in both the near and long-term
- Are all key mission areas involved in defining the vision?
<h3>Key Questions</h3>
- Who are your main internal and external customers?
- What are their primary business goals? 
- What data limitations keep your organization from achieving success?
- What key improvements do you intend to achieve in the near-term as well as long-term?
- What sort of data culture exists in your organization?

<h2><a id="Play2"></a>Play 2</h2>
**Obtain Leadership & Stakeholder Commitment** 
Obtaining stakeholder buy-in early ensures that participants understand desired outcomes and the requirements to achieve those outcomes. This buy-in requires a more open and transparent approach to exposing data and a decision-making structure that emphasizes the important role of, and improvement to, the tools that support it.
