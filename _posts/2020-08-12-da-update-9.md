<h3><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
Building mature data analytics organizations across government is a necessary step to achieve the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal of leveraging data as a strategic asset that will increase the federal government’s effectiveness, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency.
The Data Analytics Center of Excellence (CoE) drives innovation in data management, analysis and reporting for partner agencies. Its overarching goal is to enable data-driven decision-making.
The team developed this 10-play Playbook so agencies can lead more effective government policies and programs. While not every play will apply to your agency, they will help you strive towards more data-driven decisions.
The Data Analytics CoE developed this Playbook according to relevant laws, policies, and guidance, including the newly released Federal Data Strategy and OMB Circular A-11. The relevant directives provide the fundamental framework by which the CoE conducts discovery and implementation.
