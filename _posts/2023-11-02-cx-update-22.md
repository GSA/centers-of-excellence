The Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) and [18F](18f.gsa.gov) have partnered with the [Customer Experience Community of Practice (CX CoP)](https://coe.gsa.gov/communities/cx.html) to host an inaugural Federal CX Summit on November 16th, 2023. This virtual event will focus on delivering impact to customers and building CX capacity in government.

Speakers from across government will discuss the innovations, trends, and technologies that can be leveraged to enhance CX at federal agencies. Participants will leave prepared to identify the challenges and barriers that prevent government agencies from providing a positive and effective customer experience and to explore ways to overcome these challenges.
