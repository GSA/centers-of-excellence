Customer service is a key part of customer experience, but the two are not the same.

**Customer service** is an event that happens between a customer and a service provider, at a specific time and place. It’s the advice you get, the help you receive. Customer service is responsive to a person’s needs at a place and point in time. Good customer service is focused on making specific interactions positive and effective.

**Customer experience** is the sum of a person’s involvement with a brand or an agency. It encompasses all their interactions in different places, via different channels, and over time. Customer experience is about how people perceive their relationship with the service provider. It’s about how they feel, and what they do as a result.

On our part, designing good customer experiences requires us to consider the customer’s journey with our service from start to finish, even before they first come to us.
