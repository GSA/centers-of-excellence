<h3>**Our Challenges**</h3>

For new farmers or ranchers who need funding, getting a Direct Farm Loan from USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) can be 
vital to starting or growing their operations. But the application process can be complicated, especially for new producers 
who don’t have much experience farming or working with USDA. Between an unfamiliar process, a lot of paperwork, and extra 
trips to their local service center, the loan process can be stressful… even with the help of FSA loan staff dedicated to 
helping them succeed.

In Phase 1 (spring and summer of 2018), the Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) went into the field to speak 
with producers and loan officers to learn more about the pain points they faced during their loan journeys. (You can see 
what we learned in our <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/farm-loans/index.html">Direct Farm Loans Customer Journey Map and research reports</a>.

For Phase 2 (starting fall of 2018), we wanted to solve some of the producers' key pain points, by giving potential loan applicants a better, simpler view of their overall farm loan journey: What to expect, what they needed to do, and how to avoid common pitfalls. Also, we wanted our solution to use simple methods that we could deploy quickly and test with real users.

After some early research and ideation, we chose a two-part solution: a digital wizard-like Farm Loan Discovery tool, and improved paper and PDF Application Quick Guides. 

<h3>**Our Approach**</h3>

We started by working off the Phase 1 findings, then supplementing them with additional research and conversations with 
local USDA subject matter experts (SMEs). We also did a competitive analysis of the best practices of commercial lenders, 
since we needed to know what potential customers have come to expect:

Next, we created low-fidelity paper prototypes that we could use to test our assumptions with users and went back into the 
field. In a return visit to the Fredericksburg, Virginia service center, we observed how loan officers and technicians worked 
to overcome challenges and help customers. We also set aside dedicated, one-on-one time with loan staff to test our prototype 
guides. They provided invaluable feedback, flagging content that we needed to change and helping us tailor the guides to match 
how the loan process works in the real world.
