We’re working with leaders across USDA’s Farm Production and Conservation Mission Area to inform the development of Farmers.gov a simple, one-stop-shop that consolidates information for farmers, ranchers and producers.  We are actively researching who the best audience is for the information we will be producing.  One activity and tangible output of research are personas.  Personas are research-based, archetypal representations of key customers that capture what we know about our audiences. They tell stories that guide decision-making and help us develop products that align with people’s attitudes, motivations, expectations, and behaviors and what would make their lives easier.
