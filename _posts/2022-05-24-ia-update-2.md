With modernization comes change. Is your organization ready? Understanding your organization’s readiness for change and how your culture impacts change 
will influence successful technology adoption and sustainability.  

## Culture Pre-Assessment Guide
The Innovation Adoption (IA) practice area of the CoE now offers a **[Culture Pre-Assessment Guide](https://coe.gsa.gov/docs/CulturePreAssessmentGuide.pdf)** that includes guided activities to help you
understand and pre-assess your organization's culture and its potential impact on your technology modernization initiative.

The guide provides resources for an organization to conduct their own culture pre-assessment, and the interactive workshop series compliments the guide and offers peer support. 

## Upcoming Workshops
If you are interested in participating in an upcoming workshop series, please register on **[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/it-change-readiness-workshop-series-hosted-by-centers-of-excellence-coe-tickets-337459288817)** for one or all of the following sessions:

### Workshop 2: Culture Pre-Assessment
