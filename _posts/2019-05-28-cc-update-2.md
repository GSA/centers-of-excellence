A Contact Center is the bridge between your organization and your customers. Empathizing with your customers and resolving their issues in a timely and effective manner are crucial to an organization’s success. Studies have shown that positive customer experiences drive enhanced/or improved  outcomes for businesses and governmental organizations alike, with promising results in metrics such as increased customer trust in the organization. From a customer experience standpoint, here are 4 tips for measuring the success of your organization’s Contact Center performance:
  
**1) Capture simple and straightforward metrics on Customer Experience by calculating a Customer Satisfaction Score.** A quick survey with a 1-5 satisfaction ranking scale is the easiest way to collect high-level customer feedback. A survey also provides a starting point for identifying areas for improvement. Contact Centers should ideally strive to achieve 4 or 5 ratings on 90% of their customer interactions.

**2) Put issue complexity into perspective by measuring First Contact Resolution (FCR).** This metric illustrates what percentage of total inquiries are resolved during the first contact that a customer has with any channel. A high FCR score can give insight into a Contact Center’s level of success, as well as shed light on the types of inquiries are coming in (e.g., simple, complex, inter-departmental, etc.). Contact Centers should aim to have 90% of customer inquiries resolved during the first contact.

**3) Stay on top of inquiry management by adopting concrete Service Level goals.** AR is a clear indicator of customer satisfaction (or frustration). A great goal for your Contact Center is to ensure that no more than 3% of the calls are disconnected by the customer before being answered by a Customer Service Representative.

**4) Understand your Contact Center’s speed and efficiency by tracking Abandonment Rate (AR).** Another simple way to evaluate the success of your Contact Center operations is by assessing how many inquiries can be addressed in a reasonably short time frame. According to high-performing industry benchmarks, at least 80% of phone calls should be answered within 20 seconds, 98% of emails and letters within one day, and 80% of chats within 30 seconds.

These are great places to start when looking to improve performance and can help set your Contact Center up for success.
