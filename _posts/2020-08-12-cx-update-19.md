<h2><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
Customer Experience ( CX) is not new industry has been doing CX for a long time. Agencies may already be applying some or all of these best practices. 

What is new is the government’s central focus on CX with efforts such as the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) for improving customer experience, the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA), and the Federal Agency Customer Experience (FACE) Act to support CX practices. All of these efforts emphasize the government’s focus on improving the customer experience with accessing information and services. 

The Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CoE) works to develop a better understanding of
customer needs. The CX-CoE team is translating those findings into action. The team developed this
13-play playbook for practitioners in all levels of government to establish or improve CX practices,
and to foster a CX mindset within—and across—government agencies. While not every play will apply,
they can help your agency get started with small, quick wins to build up expertise and gain confidence.

This playbook represents a synthesis of ideas gathered from interviewing several subject-matter
experts (SMEs) and leaders in CX and Human-Centered Design (HCD). This synthesis is according to
relevant laws, policies, and guidance, including the updated OMB Circular A-11 “Managing Customer
Experience and Improving Service Delivery.” Whether you are just curious about CX, already dabbling
in CX, or a professional CX practitioner, this playbook can offer insight to enhance your agency’s CX
presence.

<h2><a id="Key Concepts"></a>Key Concepts</h2>
Throughout this document, we will use the following key concepts: 
- **Framework** -  A set of methodologies and approaches for delivering a product/service
  - **Human-Centered Design (HCD)**: A framework of processes that integrates a broad set of practices around understanding
 the needs, wants, and limitations of people interacting with a product/service, and that involves those people in the
 design process. It includes User-Centered Design (UCD), which deals with a person’s interaction with a digital product.
- **Methodologies** -  A set of rules governing the design effort, depending on the focus
  - **Human-Centered Design (HCD)**: A broad application of HCD to focus on the entire customer’s journey to achieve a
 particular outcome, and identify their pain points and moments of delight to help prioritize design tasks. HCD
 encompasses other method as needed.
  - **Service Design**: Focuses on understanding and improving the quality of various interactions among users, service
 personnel, and backstage actors to deliver a service.
  - **User Experience (UX)/User Interface (UI) Design**: Related disciplines focusing respectively on the end-user’s experience
 with specific digital products as part of their overall journey, and how the user gets information from,and interacts with
 specific applications and websites.
- **Approach** - Outlines the specific process used to execute the design and development
  - **Design Thinking**: General human-centered methodology of discover, design, prototype, test, implement, and repeat. Intensely collaborative and iterative with a goal to develop something useful to end users.
  - **Data**: 
    - **Quantitative**: focused on quantifying the problem by way of generating numerical data or data that can be transformed into usable statistics. It quantifies attitudes, opinions, behaviors, and other defined variables and generalizes results from a larger sample population
    - **Qualitative**: focused on establishing answers to the whys and hows of questions (unlike quantitative). Qualitative research involves asking participants about their experiences of things that happen in their lives. It enables stakeholders to obtain insights into what it feels like to be another person and to understand the world as another experiences it. Findings are described in writing, rather than numbers.
    - **Operational**: Establish key performance metrics such as KPI, ROI, Quality Assurance, marketing outcomes, employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction.

<h2><a id="Play1"></a>Play 1: Choose Your Projects Strategically</h2>
As you start, find a range of projects that can benefit the most from CX methods. Look for those key customer challenges that have high visibility and high impact, but lack a key owner. You must be able to tackle these key challenges in small sections so you can gain quick wins. Succeeding in the right initial projects will help build trust in your capabilities and prove the value of CX at your agency organization.

<h3>Checklist</h3>
- Use data to help identify these:
  - Leadership’s high-visibility initiatives
  - Opportunities to save money (e.g., consolidating similar surveys)
  - Persistent customer issues
  - Existing metrics that could use a CX perspective (e.g., call-center data, operational KPI data, any customer/employee survey data)
- Look for projects that have high customer impact but require low effort to get traction (e.g., save customers time, make things easier, decrease employee burden)
- Start small and get quick wins to gain confidence, build trust, and generate momentum. Focus on one or two customer needs instead of their entire journey while you learn the techniques and develop expertise
- Find projects that will have concrete results and measure their real change or progress over time.
<h3>Key Questions</h3>
- Which projects can show high value with the least effort and cost?
- Data: 
  - Gather data about where the most customer interactions are concentrated
  - Find out which programs fund the most services
  - Obtain report of dollars currently spent on customer feedback and contact centers
  - Collect reports from contact centers of high-volume customer pain points
  - Create journey maps to identify high-impact customer pain points
  - Review existing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics
- Tools: 
  - Review current CX CAP goal resources and match to leadership goals
  - Prepare an impact/effort matrix for potential projects to find high- impact low-effort options
  - Compare existing survey tools to identify opportunities to reduce duplication or overlap
- Engagement: 
  - Work with leadership to learn which projects are of highest priority to them
  - Understand customer engagement, team missions, and rules and regulations to identify partnership opportunity

<h2><a id="Play2"></a>Play 2: Choose Your Projects Strategically</h2>
Many of your stakeholders (and even your leadership) won’t know your CX’s purpose and methods. Explain your goals and manage expectations so you get them to cooperate. Above all, make sure you listen: not just to your external customers, but also to your internal customers and stakeholders, too.
<h3>Checklist</h3>
- Identify business owner(s) who will eventually take over the work
- Identify success metrics
- Define a specific customer goal or objective to drive the research.
- Work backwards from the goal to plan relevant research activities. Example: “We want a person to easily get a passport in seven days.”
- Determine where your stakeholders are largely focused: on technology, on business needs, on human resources, or on customer impact. Often, your project will start emphasizing one of these, and you may need to steer your stakeholders to re-balance these four elements
- Assure stakeholders the purpose is not to audit current operations, but rather simply to listen, above all else, to customers/staff about their experiences
- Prepare a written agreement (e.g. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), engagement letter) describing the goals and approach of the activity, planned tasks and schedule, and level of participation for all parties
<h3>Key Questions</h3>
- Is the problem statement of your research for the selected project clear to you and your stakeholders?
  - Maintain flexibility to adjust the plan as you learn more about the customer
- Data: Identify the business owner(s) to gain access to data
- Tools: 
  - Obtain a signed MOU, engagement letter, Interagency Agreement, or ad hoc/informal letter of agreement
  - Prepare a project work plan
- Engagements: 
  - Get executive sponsorship
  - Talk to other stakeholders who may be affected by or interested in this project
  - Understand the constraints of stakeholders to build trust so that you can shift your approach as needed without losing momentum

<h2><a id="Play3"></a>Play 3: Identify Your Customers</h2>
Before you can understand your customers, you have to know
who they are. Then you can create personas representing your
different customer types. You’ll use those personas as
reference points to focus your thinking on your customers as
you develop solutions to meet their needs.
<h3>Checklist</h3>
- Identify who your program/agency/cross-agency
consortium serves, which may include internal and
external agencies, vendors, citizens, and employees
- Document a persona (i.e.,fact-based yet fictional
representation) for each customer you identify, capturing
demographics, preferences, and activities related to your
program/service and desired outcomes. Show that you not
only identify your customers, you actually understand
them
- Data:
  - Collect data about visitors to the website, call center,
social media, but use the data cautiously—not all
visitors to these channels are your customers
  - Identify unique characteristics that clearly
distinguish specific customers from one another
(e.g., programs they participate in, products they
produce, etc.)
  - Review existing customer segmentation data—a
persona could represent a defined segment
<h3>Key Questions</h3>
- Who are your customers (whether direct or
indirect)?
- How well do you know them?
- Tools: 
  - Synthesize existing customer insights to determine
who your customers are and what motivates them
  - Have workshops to select traits and have a picture
(e.g., photograph or illustration) that belong to each
persona to bring the persona to life
- Engagement: 
  - Interview a sample of the customers to gain insights
into their values, needs, perspectives, and pain
points
  - Involve a cross-functional group of stakeholders to
get many perspectives
