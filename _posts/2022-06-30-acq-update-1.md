Industry Engagement (IE) plays a significant role in procurement, which is vital to successful modernization. Early, frequent, and constructive communication with industry leads to better acquisition outcomes. The most effective IE methods blend various types of strategic and tactical approaches to achieve better proposal responses and ultimately, better contract performance.

As part of our new [Resources & Advisory Support collection](https://coe.gsa.gov/2022/05/20/coe-update-4.html), the CoE’s Acquisition practice has created a [Guide to Building Effective Industry Engagement](https://coe.gsa.gov/docs/BuildingEffectiveIndustryEngagementGuide.pdf) to help prepare organizations across government to develop and improve Industry Engagement (IE) in relation to IT modernization. We developed this guide based on our experiences working with procurement professionals across the federal government. 

Although the guide doesn't represent or constitute official guidance, using the assessment, solutions and methods within, organizations at starter levels of IE can use the resources in the guide to identify core challenges, and start to develop strategies for continual industry engagement and successful acquisitions. Tailor them to meet your agency’s specific needs.  

## Building Better Industry Engagement Workshop Series
CoE’s Acquisition practice leads will offer a two-part workshop series that will help you assess your organization’s current level of IE, understand how your agency approaches IE, identify opportunities for growth and develop solutions for current challenges. 

**Workshop 1: IE Overview & Make Connections – July 12, 2022 at 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.EST**
Take the first step to collecting and analyzing information about capabilities within the market to satisfy agency needs! In this session we will help you understand the foundation for more effective IE and assess your level of IE.

In these optional office hours, subject matter experts will be available to address questions you may have on Workshop 1 activities and improving your organization’s industry engagement. 

**Workshop 2: Techniques & Forums – July 21, 2022 11 a.m. - 12 p.m. EST**
