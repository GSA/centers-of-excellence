The <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/">General Services Administration (GSA)</a> has partnered with the 
<a href="https://www.opm.gov/">U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)</a> to provide assistance with their modernization efforts. Through a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/gsa-it">GSA Office of the Chief Information Officer (GSA IT)</a> and the <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/">Centers of Excellence (CoE)</a>, OPM will be able to stabilize their infrastructure, laying the foundation for the transformative efforts that could then follow.

CoE utilized the material provided by GSA IT and OPM to develop a Draft Request for Quotation (Draft RFQ). This Draft RFQ, along with its associated artifacts, have been <a href="https://github.com/GSA/coe-opm-mainframe-dr-plan">made available online</a> in order to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkeXfdYY4_qMGIA7T4D6M7wyA8eweGy7wbg4rjPGLKJouNpQ/viewform">obtain industry feedback</a>.

CoE is looking for ways to improve the Draft RFQ so that OPM ends up with the necessary equipment to stand up two disaster 
recovery mainframes in Macon, Georgia and Boyers, Pennsylvania. This is important in that it will help stabilize OPM’s IT i
nfrastructure and allow OPM’s modernization efforts to begin in earnest.

Additionally, in order to ensure OPM obtains the best possible value, CoE is seeking information that will allow it to help 
OPM decide whether to purchase all, lease all, or purchase some and lease some of the equipment. What is most important is 
that the workflows associated with these mainframes operate without any lapse in service, but after ensuring that, OPM is 
hoping to lay the foundation for the future of their IT infrastructure.

OPM is the third agency to partner with the CoE, following successful launches at the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/">U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/coe-hud-acquisitions/">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</a>.
