<em>In June 2022, the CoE Innovation Adoption (IA) practice published a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/CulturePreAssessmentGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Culture Pre-Assessment Guide</a> and hosted a workshop series to highlight how elements of culture can help or hinder an agency’s IT modernization initiative and exposed participants to the tools that can be used to conduct a culture pre-assessment. Over 50 federal employees from nearly 20 different organizations were in attendance.</em>

Culture sets the foundation for change and helps innovators understand the larger organizational landscape. Understanding readiness for change and how the culture of an organization impacts change is fundamental to getting on the right track for successful technology innovation. Change readiness is the first in the IA team’s C3 Framework – a three-part approach that includes assessing Culture, Capabilities, and Conditions.

## Culture types

In the first workshop, participants identified their organization’s change position and type – open to change, skeptical or somewhere in between – and discussed the following:
- Are people in my organization interacting and speaking to each other using the same language?
- Is everyone comfortable and safe to voice their opinions and share their experiences?
- What has their experience been with prior change? 
- What types of barriers or challenges make enterprise-wide technology implementation difficult?

Some attendees shared a common challenge – tying every job back to their organization’s values and mission. Others shared that silos in their organization pose the biggest challenges, and that it's important to proactively break them down to drive modernization initiatives. These are great examples of how different cultures can encounter different challenges in the change and modernization space.

## Stakeholders and buy-in

Behind every change initiative are stakeholders with varying levels of impact. The assumptions and beliefs we uncover with assessments are critical because it can be these very things that make or break the success of innovation projects. 

The second workshop took attendees on a deep dive into discovery. By offering suggestions on artifact collection and stakeholder identification – two key components to identify key resources, advocates, supporters and blockers – attendees were able to visualize a path forward and practice using tools that will help set up modernization initiatives for success. 

Participants were invited to office hours to continue the conversation and answer additional questions on how they might conduct a pre-assessment in their organization.  

## Takeaways

“Learning from other agencies and sharing possible solutions was exciting. The presentation had very useful information that I plan to research more and implement.”

“It was great to connect with other feds and learn about core approaches and tools for assessing culture.”

<em>June’s IA culture workshop series was inaugural. Feedback captured from participants will allow for improvements and additions to future workshops. Look out for a repeat of the series in Fall 2022.
