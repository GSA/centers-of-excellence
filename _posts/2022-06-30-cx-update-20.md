A recent executive order on improving customer experience and service delivery holds 17 agencies accountable for 36 specific commitments, but it is a call to action for the entire federal government.

*“Our government must recommit to being ‘of the people, by the people, and for the people’ in order to solve the complex 21st century challenges our nation faces. Government must be held accountable for designing and delivering services with a focus on the actual experience of the people whom it is meant to serve.”*

Is CX transformation in your future? CX can help agencies better deliver on their mission and provide better services to the people it serves. But CX work covers a lot of ground, often encompassing the experiences of both internal and external customers. It goes beyond digital services and extends into supporting policies, internal processes and governance structures of the service. And to do CX well and sustainably requires agencies to mature and build specific capabilities.

## CoE’s CX Maturity Model
The [CX CoE](https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/customer-experience.html) has created a [Maturity Model](https://coe.gsa.gov/docs/CXMaturityModel.pdf), a framework to help organizations transform their federal service delivery. It is designed to provide organizations with a deeper understanding of how to measure their maturity level, and tactics to get to the next level.

Although the CX Maturity Model does not represent or constitute official guidance, it can help you take your organization’s CX Maturity to the next level. Tailor the model to meet your agency’s specific needs.  

## Upcoming Office Hour
Our CX CoE leads will host complimentary office hours to provide an overview of the model and answer any questions, via ZoomGov on **July 13, 2022 from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. EST**.
