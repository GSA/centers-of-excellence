Since we started, we have engaged with leaders across the federal government to understand the excitement, challenges, and opportunities surrounding AI as an enabling technology.

- what it can and cannot do, and 
- how to apply it to federal agenciesâ€™ mission areas. 

This is meant to be an evolving guide to the application of AI for the U.S. federal government, because AI is a rapidly evolving set of technologies.
