The AI CMM is not meant to normatively assess capabilities, but to highlight milestones that indicate maturity levels throughout the AI journey.

The AI CMM is a tool that helps organizations develop their unique AI roadmap and investment plan. The results of AI CMM analysis enable decision makers to identify investment areas that meet both near-term goals for quick AI adoption and broader enterprise business goals over the long term.
