Operational maturity areas represent organizational functions that impact the implementation of AI capabilities. 
{: .intro }

While each area is treated as a discrete capability for maturity evaluation, they generally depend on one another. The operational maturity areas are:

- **[PeopleOps](#peopleops)**: Recruit, develop, retain, and organize an AI-ready workforce.
- **[CloudOps](#cloudops)**: Provide and allocate storage, compute, and other resources in the cloud.
- **[SecOps](#secops)**: Ensure secure deployment of code, access to systems and data, and identity resolution across storage, compute, and data assets.
- **[DevOps](#devops)**: Deploy and manage software throughout development, test, and production environments.
- **[DataOps](#dataops)**: Maximize data discovery, access, and use throughout its lifecycle.
- **[MLOps](#mlops)**: Test, experiment, and deploy AI or ML models.
- **[AIOps](#aiops)**:  Identify and resource AI initiatives within the organization.

Each operational maturity area below is supported by related key activities and key questions to focus the conversation on the current organizational state.

## PeopleOps

People are at the core of every organization. PeopleOps covers not only the defining skills required to build and deploy AI capabilities, but also creating a culture that promotes the behavior necessary to successfully create intelligent systems.
{: .intro }

Organizations must be able to explicitly identify skill sets and traits that make a strong AI team. We focus intentionally on continuously developing skill sets, technical acumen, and dynamic team management. We also identify talent gaps and provide training. Strong PeopleOps practices include the structure and program support to organize high-functioning teams and manage them throughout the entire talent lifecycle.
