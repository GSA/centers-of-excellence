The continuously evolving landscape of AI solutions promises to fundamentally change the way that businesses, governments, and society as a whole interact with and impact the world around us. While some of the promises of change may be years or even decades away, the technological possibilities represent exciting opportunities. As AI continues to evolve, AI practitioners must carefully consider the impact of AI on the people who interact with it and are affected by it.

With the rapid adoption of AI in the private sector many examples exist representing how AI can go wrong. These examples include when a lack of responsible AI practices resulted in the unintended consequences of what an algorithm could do, especially if the underlying data is not carefully curated, monitored and evaluated. 

For the implementation of responsible AI practices, interdisciplinary teams including AI technicians, program-specific subject matter experts, and end-users must be included. Those involved in the building, deploying, and monitoring of AI systems simply cannot ignore the impact of the technology they are building and how the results of the technology affect the people that use it. 

This is especially true for government innovation. The mission of the government is to serve the people and when AI is used to meet that mission, government should take extra precautions to ensure that the application of AI in government is used responsibly. Part of the challenge is that AI is evolving at such a rapid pace, that frameworks, tools, and guidance will need to be updated and improved as more is learned.

This chapter does not aim to solve all of the challenges of responsible AI implementation. Nor does it aim to create any standards, guidelines, or an additional set of principles for using AI responsibly. Rather, it aims to provide key questions and considerations to encourage government practitioners to think critically about AI systems they are building or implementing to highlight any potential risks or areas where there may be ethical concerns.
