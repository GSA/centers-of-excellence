This chapter is a first step in responsible and trustworthy AI implementation, but like the iteration and innovation occurring in AI, this will be an 
ongoing effort. Asking these types of questions will not solve all challenges, nor does answering them ensure compliance with any standards, guidelines, 
or additional principles for using AI responsibly. Practitioners must be critically thinking of these key questions, considerations, and potential risks 
while building or implementing AI systems. 

As this space is evolving rapidly, many experts are putting considerable thought into how to [implement responsible and trustworthy AI](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1270-draft.pdf) principles and embed 
them into the [day-to-day operations](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2022/03/17/AI-RMF-1stdraft.pdf) of a product or project team. As authoritative literature in responsible and trustworthy AI grows and changes, itâ€™s 
advantageous to stay up-to-date and look to members of the AI community, both in the public and private sector for guidance. The Technology Transformation 
Services Centers of Excellence look forward to helping you on this journey and will provide updates as the field grows.
