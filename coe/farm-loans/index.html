            <p class="intro">The Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) team had the privilege of partnering with the USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) to understand the experience of producers and service center staff in applying for and processing direct farm loan applications.</p>
            <p>The CX CoE team applied a farmer-centered and staff-centered design model to tackle this challenge. We conducted interviews and ethnographic observations with over 40 subject matter experts and employees in Washington DC and at six service centers, and almost 40 producers in six states. We also hosted four workshops with stakeholders in Washington, DC to guide the research, update the customer journey map, vet important findings, and develop recommended solutions to improve the customer experience.</p>
            <p>Through this research, the CX CoE team built a <a href="#journeymap">Journey Map</a> that reflects the experience of producers and loan officers as they move through a typical application. </p>

Some topics and conversations were rich with detail, and lead to the development of a set of customer stories that provide a more detailed look into the lives of these FSA customers. </p>
            <p>The customer stories are composites, sometimes bringing in details from several interviews in order to communicate the observations in a more compact and impactful form.
