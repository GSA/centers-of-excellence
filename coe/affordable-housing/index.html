        <div class="usa-width-one-half">
            <p class="intro">To introduce HUD to human-centered design best practices, the Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) team conducted a demonstration project focused on the journey to affordable housing for seniors. We researched the current journey for seniors and associated activities for HUD and HUD community partners as a case study that exemplifies the common experiences of all citizens seeking affordable housing. In collaboration with a cross-program CX working group at HUD, we developed insights by identifying common themes and recommended solutions to address real challenges experienced through this journey.</p>

                <p>The CX CoE team conducted more than fifty (50) one-on-one qualitative interviews with seniors, intermediaries, and HUD staff in the Washington, D.C. metro area, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, in collaboration with HUD staff representing a cross-program working group. This research culminated in the Affordable Housing for Seniors Journey Map, a launching pad for brainstorming HUD’s role in creating customer-centric solutions that positively impact all citizens.</p>

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p class="intro">The CX CoE’s research generated an understanding of how citizens and intermediaries experience affordable housing processes. Here we present three key findings and 4 customer stories as a sample of the findings. We encourage you to learn more about our findings in the Key Insights and Recommendations report.</p>
        <div class="usa-width-one-whole">
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p>In addition to the wide range of pain points and specific challenges that were uncovered in interviews, several common and pervasive themes emerged. These challenges came up repeatedly in interviews with people from different organizations and with different responsibilities who interact with different programs at HUD. </p>

        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
            <h4>Lack of Control</h4>
            <p>Supporting seniors’ sense of control in the housing process is a clear opportunity to improve their quality of life. When people experience shelter uncertainty, all other aspects of life are impacted. The challenges of aging — deteriorating mental and physical health, memory and mobility loss, loneliness, and other factors — amplify the impact of uncertainty and create barriers to self sufficiency. Feeling in control of their housing situations can reduce these impacts. </p> 
        </div> <!-- /.usa-width-one-third -->
        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
            <h4>Decisions without Transparency</h4>
            <p>The disparity between the supply and demand of affordable housing creates a burden on everyone in the supply chain — citizens, HUD, and every one in between. Attempting to build equitable processes for access to affordable housing has manifested in complex, siloed waitlist systems that create administrative work for PHAs and property managers, and increases both confusion and overhead for citizens. Increasing transparency about the affordable housing process and aligning and automating administrative burdens may mitigate the impact of these opaque systems. </p>
        </div> <!-- /.usa-width-one-third -->
        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
            <h4>Disaggregated Knowledge</h4>
            <p>Much of the data about conditions on the ground in communities is reported to HUD HQ by community partners as part of compliance efforts. HUD uses this data to guide policy decisions at a national level, but the data does not enable local decision-making and action for field office staff and community partners. HUD has an opportunity to consolidate community information across program areas for magnified situational awareness, and to offer decision-making tools to field offices and community partners to improve service delivery locally. </p>

            <p class="intro">The CX CoE work is guided by customer research - structured conversations with a cross-section of seniors, site managers, PHA staff, HUD field staff, and HUD HQ staff. </p>
            <p>The Findings and Recommendations Report synthesizes the data collected through interviews and offers a vision to guide high value customer experiences and it offers specific ideas for addressing the pain points identified. </p>
            <p>The Briefing Deck serves as an executive summary and overview of the findings of the research.</p> 
            <p>The How Might HUDs were used in the solutioning workshop to brainstorm ideas with HUD staff. After the workshop, we added the solution ideas to these so they serve as a comprehensive look at the paint points, opportunity, and ideas generated with HUD.</p>
