        <h2 id="infrastructure optimization playbook">Infrastructure Optimization Playbook</h2>

            <p>As the public sector continues to modernize its technology, agencies continue to increase demand on their IT infrastructures. Rather than rely on meeting this new demand in the face of flat or reduced budgets, the pace of innovation has created opportunities to optimize infrastructure and create better service, while improving efficiency and generating savings simultaneously.</p>
            
            <p>The Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals showcase the governmentâ€™s focus on improving the customer experience with accessing information and services. Building mature data organizations across government is a necessary step for achieving the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal of leveraging data as a strategic asset, in order to: grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the federal government, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency.</p>
             
            <p>The Infrastructure Optimization Center of Excellence (CoE) assists in optimizing data centers and reducing infrastructure costs and developed this 10-play Playbook for federal government agencies who are looking for assistance in their development and implementation of infrastructure optimization, integrated cloud computing, and data center consolidation strategies.</p>

            <h3 class="title"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2018/05/17/io-update-1.html">18 Data Centers Closed</a></h3>

            <p>IT Infrastructure Optimization CoE is supporting the USDA with their consolidation of data centers from 39 to 2. With accelerated closure planning and data center site visits, USDA has already met their closure goal for FY18 by closing 18 data centers. The CoE and USDA will continue to accelerate closures by helping agencies develop their migration planning/project plans for the remaining data centers scheduled to close in FY19. The CoE is supporting USDA mission areas by conducting application rationalization assessments on applications impacted by closures. The IT Infrastructure Optimization CoE is working with agency stakeholders, assessing the value of these closures to USDA, and providing executive briefings on the progress USDA is making towards its modernization work.</p>
