             <p>Today’s challenging missions require modern IT moving in lock-step with the business. The cloud enables agile delivery of features, which makes customers happy, and enhances cybersecurity to better protect systems and data. To get these results, agencies will need to think, work, and buy technology differently.</p> 
             <p>Cloud adoption empowers agencies to modernize processes, cybersecurity and workforce skills. The Cloud Adoption Center Of Excellence (CoE) analyzes systems and applications to recommend optimal pathways to the cloud and the team developed an 8-play Playbook to help agencies leverage an agile and flexible framework to accelerate cloud adoption across the enterprise. The Cloud CoE provides hands-on technical assistance to agencies in conducting their migration planning to achieve their respective cloud strategy goals.</p>

            <h3 class="title"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2018/05/23/ca-update-1.html">Creating a Cloud First Organization</a></h3>

            <p>The Cloud Adoption CoE facilitated a workshop for USDA technical leaders.  The objective was to provide background information and gain stakeholder support for the foundation of the Commercial Cloud Platform Services (CCPS) organization.  CCPS is to be the USDA pathway to cloud services and is contingent on the acceptance and participation of all workshop attendees. The workshop was conducted as a collaborative two-day offsite that brought together stakeholders from across OCIO to discuss roles, responsibilities and expectations in conducting next steps.  The CCPS is a logical first step for USDA to leverage and harness the commercial cloud marketplace to add value to farmers, ranchers, and producers (consumers) via three primary roles:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Aggregation</b>: Combining and integrating multiple services</li>
                <li><b>Service Intermediation</b>: Provisioning of value-added services or improving a capability without actually providing any of the cloud services itself (identity and access management, security management and reporting)</li>
                <li><b>Service Arbitrage</b>:  Enabling providers to combine various cloud services into one or more aggregated cloud services to USDA cloud consumers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Attendee feedback has painted the workshop as a productive step toward success and sustainment of the CCPS. More importantly, these OCIO stakeholders reached agreement on a plan to move forward as a team – with the purpose of creating a firm foundation of trust amongst peers. This is regarded as the definitive success of the workshop. While the cloud has potential to transform the USDA IT ecosystem, “trust as purpose” is often transformative for the team; it offers the real possibility that together we can act in service to a shared higher aspiration. “One IT” supporting “One USDA.”</p>
