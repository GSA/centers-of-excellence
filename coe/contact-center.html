            <p>The GSA Center of Excellence (CoE) for Contact Center of the Future conducted best practice research on leading contact centers. The CoE studied organizations known for their exemplary customer experience  in both the public sector (e.g., Center for Disease Control) and private sector (e.g., Microsoft). These studies illuminated trends in managing successful contact center optimization efforts, such as shifting to lower tiers for cost savings, implementing emerging technology, and developing a workforce strategy to account for surges and slumps in call volume.</p>
            <p>
                Drawing from these learnings, the CoE is embedding known best practices and innovative strategies in the plan for the OneUSDA Contact Center. As the CoE "Lighthouse Agency," the future OneUSDA Contact Center will serve as a best practice leader itself, and will act as a model for other government agencies to follow.

                    The GSA Center of Excellence (CoE) for Contact Center of the Future conducted extensive research on contact center innovations to improve customer experience. This Whitepaper, Emerging Technologies in Contact Centers, synthesizes this research into two key innovation trends: omnichannel services and emerging technologies. Omnichannel services allow customers consistent, frictionless experience across communication channels, while emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and Internet of Things (IoT) drive efficiencies. The CoE is working to leverage these trends to increase customer satisfaction while lowering costs.

            <p>On April 3, 2018, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue launched his second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcwG4iwN6Fk">“Backed to Our Roots”</a> RV Tour across the country.</p>

            <div class="inline-media">
                <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/contact-center/sonny-postcard.png" alt="We Want to Hear from You postcard" class="img-responsive">
            </div> <!-- /.inline-media -->

            <p>In support of this tour, the Contact Center CoE, in partnership with USDA’s Office of Communications and Office of Customer Experience, helped launch a single, easy to use web form and an toll-free number that allows the public to provide direct feedback to USDA leadership.</p>

            <p>In close collaboration with USDA staff and agency leadership, the CoE developed questions for the web form and contact center script. The CoE created created short-term solution for escalating customer issues and ensuring their inquiries are resolved.  Supporting Tell Sonny gave us important insights into USDA’s internal processes and points of contact for the intake, tracking, and resolving of customer feedback and provides a great preview for our broader CoE work around the Voice of the Customer.</p>
