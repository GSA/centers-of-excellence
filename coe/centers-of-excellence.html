            <h3 class="title">GSA announced the next partnership for the CoE</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced they are teaming up for a discovery sprint as part of GSA’s Centers of Excellence (CoE) initiative. By bringing the CoE model to HUD, GSA will utilize the expertise of the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) team within GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) to begin a comprehensive assessment of the IT needs and challenges facing the department.  </p>
            <p>“I’m thrilled HUD is teaming up with GSA to transform this agency into a more effective and efficient servant on behalf of the American people,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. “This is an important moment for HUD as we embark upon a campaign to modernize our aging technology and bring true financial integrity to everything we do.”</p>

            <h3 class="title">USDA Phase II Industry Day</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/">General Services Administration</a> (GSA) <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service">Federal Acquisition Service</a> (FAS) and <a href="https://www.usda.gov/">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) hosted an Industry Day on June 27, 2018 and Reverse Industry Days on June 28 and 29, 2018 for Phase II of the Centers of Excellence (CoE). Phase II will involve implementing recommendations generated during Phase I. If you were unable to attend, you can view the recorded livestream of the event, see below.</p>

        <p>At the Industry Day, the CoE presented the number and scope of procurements, communicated the acquisition strategy, and updated industry on the progress of USDA as the first CoE customer. The goal for this event was to address questions and solicit feedback from our industry partners before the solicitations were released.</p>

        <p>GSA also hosted Reverse Industry Days on the 28th and 29th, consisting of one-on-one sessions with industry partners, where they reviewed industry capabilities offered to the various CoE teams. Subsequently, GSA advertised several orders under Alliant, the Professional Services Schedule, Schedule 70, and other GSA vehicles to address USDA’s Phase II needs.</p>
