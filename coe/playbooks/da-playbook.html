                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The American people increasingly interact with the government through digital channels such as websites, email, and mobile applications. This activity generates an immense amount of data. By building digital services that take advantage of modern technology and proven industry standards, we can make data-driven decisions that lead to more effective government policies and programs.</p>
                    <p>Today, there aren’t enough government agencies taking advantage of the vast volumes of data. To increase the use of this data, the Centers of Excellence have created a playbook of 14 key “plays” drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help government develop and sustain effective data analytics in their organization. Building mature data organizations across government is a necessary step for achieving the Cross Agency Priority (CAP) goal of leveraging data as a strategic asset, in order to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency.</p>

                <h2>Define a Vision</h2>
                <p>Achieving data analytics maturity at all levels of a large organization is a multi-year process involving sustained focus on people, processes, and technologies. Defining a clear and realistic vision of near-term and long-term states is an important first step in assessing an organization’s analytics prospects and devising a suitable strategy to mature them. Think about broad outcomes that would meaningfully contribute to your organization’s mission, e.g. “more timely monthly reporting”, “respond to all customer inquiries within 24 hours”, or “understand drivers for performance improvement”.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define key business or administrative errors for which major advances would meaningfully impact mission success.</li>
                    <li>At a high-level, document the types of concrete outcomes that would contribute to that mission success</li>
                    <li>Develop an overarching vision statement to explain what data analytics could mean to the organization, in both the near- and long-term</li>
                    <li>Revise and refine this vision during the course of the assessment and subsequent implementation phases</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Obtain Leadership/Stakeholder Commitment</h2>
                <p>Analytics projects require access to data, often sensitive in nature, that is ‘secured’ behind IT firewalls (real or imagined). Business owners may be reluctant to hand over data that may be of poor quality, difficult to understand, or could reflect poorly on their work. They may also be wary of change to their processes or lack of documentation. Thus, setting in motion and sustaining a culture shift that starts at the top is an important component in achieving a meaningful shift to data-driven decision making. Obtaining stakeholder buy-in in advance ensures that participants understand desired outcomes and requirements to achieve those outcomes. This includes a more open and transparent approach to exposing data and a decision-making structure that emphasizes the important role of and improvement to tools that support it.</p>

                <h2>Assess the Organization</h2>
                <p>Analytics success builds on the right combination of people, processes, and technology. All are required to facilitate the delivery of timely data to accessible and useful tools that effectively support data-driven decision making. Seemingly small bottlenecks or challenges in any one area can significantly impact success. A broad assessment of those aspects of the organization is an important early step in making sure that advances in data analytics address the necessary components. An organizational assessment should document the overlap of technology and data platforms, core business workflows (processes), and the people involved in those processes or the recipients of outputs of those processes. Documentation of the organization does not need to be overly complex, but should focus on core work streams, including commonalities between workstreams. Annotated graphical documentation can be considered sufficient.</p>

                <h2>Assess Analytical Maturity</h2>
                <p>Analytical maturity refers to where an agency stands in terms of data usage, data process, and data analytics. Different departments/agencies often find themselves at varying levels of maturity when it comes to analytics. Some elements of your organization may be solid candidates for rapid advances in analytics maturity, while others may be limited by staff, funding, or infrastructure challenges. Setting realistic expectations for pace of improvement starts with understanding the maturity level of the organization now. An analytical maturity assessment can help establish for leadership where an organization stands and pinpoint specific gaps or areas that need particular emphasis. Much of the information required for completing the analytical maturity assessment comes from the organizational assessment. A standard questionnaire can be used to assess maturity across a range of topics, including: data governance organization, data quality and systems, analytical techniques, process automation, staff expertise, infrastructure and change management.</p>

                <h2>Assess Data Flows</h2>
                <p>The accessibility and timeliness of data is a key consideration for robust, evidenced-based decision making. It is therefore critical to ensure that data flows within an organization are fully understood and documented so they can be optimized. Removing inefficiencies in processing data can improve its effectiveness, reduce costs, and ensure reliability. Simplifying data flows and the associated IT systems makes it easier for them to be accessible, flexible, and extensible, promoting increased use to drive insights and decisions within the organization. As much as possible during the course of assessing data flows, it is essential to work to catalog data sources, data quality, key/common data fields across datasets, storage mechanisms and limitations, transformations or other processing applied to data, deliverables or artifacts produced that include data, and uses of the data by end product consumers.</p>

                <h2>Collect Strategic Requirements</h2>
                <p>To be truly effective, the design and development of data systems and related tools must be driven by the needs of end users. Eliciting strategic and higher-level functional requirements from end users who don’t understand data limitations or options can be difficult. Start with the capabilities afforded by their current system, but probe to understand what business questions they have and cannot answer, how an ideal system would deliver business insights, and the frequency with which they would be delivered. Think about the potential for predictive analytics to help drive decisions, not just reflect historical trends. Ensure the focus is on what the end user wants,  and not how it will be accomplished or whether it’s immediately doable. Set realistic expectations with the end users about what your team is trying to accomplish in the near-term, and make clear that achieving end goals will be an iterative process. Lastly, consider bringing customer experience experts into the conversation to elicit information about how the current process works (a journey map, for example), and what would make an ideal system the most usable.</p>

                <p>The current state architecture is an amalgamation of information gathered from all the previous plays, from defining a vision through the collection of strategic requirements. With this knowledge, the organization can map out all the capabilities available in the current environment. The current state architecture document presents the information at a high level that can be understood by multiple types of stakeholders, ranging from management, to technical leadership, to program staff. It should address the front-end applications utilized by business users as well as the supporting back-end hardware and software. As much as possible, it should also reflect the business processes and the associated flow of data within the architecture. In large organizations with multiple work streams and diverse business areas, a set of diagrams depicting the overall current state architecture might make sense. Make sure to reflect any data or process links between the disparate work streams.</p>

                <p>The target state defines what the organization’s information management structure would ideally look like, based on the leadership vision and strategic goals previously established. The target state architecture will be achieved iteratively through short term and long term achievements, and should encompass the right integration of technologies, roles/people, and processes to further the organization’s stated mission. Key to defining the target state architecture is addressing critical data sets, their integration and transformation, and the process of delivering timely insights directly to decision-makers. A target state architecture should clearly illustrate how business users’ needs will be met (see “collect strategic requirements” above) and the processes and tools that are necessary. Also, begin to consider questions or issues around data and information security by indicating where in the target state architecture (internal or external to your organization) controls must be included.</p>

                <h2>Create an Implementation Roadmap</h2>
                <p>Once the current and desired future state has been defined, the next step is to create an implementation roadmap that details the concrete steps required to arrive at the target state architecture. Think of the roadmap as a series of related milestones that will be achieved in the areas of people, process, and technologies. The roadmap will also begin to detail the design and development plan, timing, and resources required to achieve identified milestones during the course of the implementation phase. The roadmap should be sufficiently forward-looking to ensure it’s moving your organization in the right long-term, strategic direction — we recommend a roadmap that extends at least five years into the future. Use the priority areas identified in the gap analysis to identify important near-term milestones and evaluate the overall roadmap for proper sequencing of activities.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify a single role/individual to own the roadmap (e.g. CIO, data officer)</li>
                    <li>Ensure that milestones in the areas of people, processes, and technologies are all considered and properly sequenced</li>
                    <li>Associate notional (or better) timeframes and resources requirements with milestones and associated activities</li>
                    <li>At least annually, review the roadmap to confirm and/or update priorities</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Key Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have key stakeholders within the organization had an opportunity to review and provide feedback?</li>
                    <li>Do the initial roadmap milestones address opportunities for quick-wins in the highest priority areas?</li>
                    <li>How do activities in the roadmap align with ongoing activities or already planned acquisitions/hires?</li>
                    <li>Are steps within your roadmap overly aggressive, or is maturity achieved through measured, iterative improvement?</li>
                    <li>What are your success factors and how will you measure them during implementation?</li>

                <h2>Establish a Data Governance Structure</h2>
                <p>Data governance is the “collection of policies, frameworks, and approaches employed to manage and monitor data within an organization.” These typically address the interactions between people, processes, and technology to ensure high data confidence, robust security, and effective and timely delivery of information to end users. Establishment of a data governance group is recommended to standardize data processes across the organization and ensure that data roles are clearly defined — this clear assignment of data-related responsibilities, including oversight, ownership, and championing — is a key aim of the data governance structure.</p>

                <h2>Create an Enterprise Data Model</h2>
                <p>An Enterprise Data Model (EDM) is an integrated view of the data produced and consumed across an entire organization. It represents a single integrated definition of data, unbiased of any system or application, and is independent of how the data is physically sourced, stored, processed, or accessed. The model consists of enterprise-wide subject areas, fundamental entities and their relationships, and unified terms and definitions. EDM unites, formalizes and represents the things important to an organization, as well as the rules governing them. Typical outputs of this activity include Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), XML Schemas (XSD), and an enterprise-wide Data Dictionary.</p>

                <h2>Emphasize Rapid Prototyping</h2>
                <p>Traditional waterfall approaches to application development — a long cycle of requirements collection, followed by a long development cycle, then release — have proven ineffective. Rapid prototyping of capabilities and frequent collection of user feedback, implemented through agile development processes, result in more useful and usable products for end users. Because end users are involved throughout the design cycle, rapid prototyping is especially effective for building consensus around technical approaches and identifying specific, incremental enhancements to mature processes and technologies.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Utilize cross-functional teams of developers, testers, and business owners to prototype</li>
                    <li>Use minimally viable products (MVPs) as a standard for prototyping — these are functioning tools or models that provide real value, though on a limited scale, or support a portion of a process</li>
                    <li>Prototype streamlined processes and MVPs independently, then together</li>
                    <li>Use actual business data and real business processes, informed by insights from data owners</li>
                    <li>Prototype capabilities for actual end users and collect feedback throughout the development process</li>
                    <li>Consider adopting an agile development process — working in development sprints of 1-2 weeks</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Embrace Continuous Process Improvement</h2>
                <p>Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) is the ongoing, constant enhancement of products, services, or processes applied throughout the implementation phase. These changes can either be incremental or breakthrough. The goal is to incrementally increase effectiveness and efficiency of the organization in fulfilling its mission, through small steps that move towards a more mature state. The key to CPI is 1) implementing feedback mechanisms that continually collect input from system and process stakeholders, coupled with 2) a change management process that systematically implements and monitors the value of improvements.</p>
