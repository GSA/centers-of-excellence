                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Customer Experience (CX) Playbook is for practitioners in all levels of government to establish or improve CX practices and foster a CX mindset within and across government agencies by getting started with small, quick wins to build up expertise and gain confidence. The plays are prepared in support of the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals, and the General Services Administration (GSA) Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE).</p>
                    <p>CX is not a new concept – it’s what industry has been doing for a long time. In fact, you may already do some of these activities. What is new is the government’s central focus as part of the PMA and CAP goals to bolster support and resources towards CX practices.</p>
                    <p>This playbook represents a synthesis of ideas gathered from interviewing several subject matter experts and leaders in CX and Human Centered Design (HCD) in government. Whether you are just curious about CX, already dabbling in CX, or a professional CX practitioner, this playbook can offer insight to grow the CX presence in your agency.</p>
                    <p>The playbook is designed to allow you to dive into any play in any sequence best applicable to your needs and is organized around three focus areas: <u>Practice</u>, <u>Measure</u>, <u>Grow</u>. Start practicing with small projects and limited resources, and develop support over time. You don’t have to have <em>everything</em> in place to do <em>something</em>.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Framework</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A set of methodologies and approaches for delivering a product/service.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Human Centered Design (HCD):</strong> Framework of processes that integrates a broad set of practices around understanding the needs, wants, and limitations of people interacting with a product/service, and involves those people in the design process.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Centered Design (UCD):</strong> A subset of HCD pertaining to a person’s interaction with a digital product.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Methodologies</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Establishes a set of rules governing the design effort, depending on the focus.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Customer Experience (CX):</strong> A human-centered design broad methodology to focus on the entire journey of a customer to achieve a particular outcome, and identify their pain points and moments of delight to help prioritize design tasks. The CX methodology encompasses the other methodologies, as needed for a particular analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Design:</strong> Focuses on understanding and improving the quality of various interactions between users, service personnel and backstage actors to deliver a service.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong> Focuses specifically on the end user’s experience with a specific product, typically a specific digital technology, as only one part of their overall journey.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Interface Design (UI):</strong> Focuses on how to maximize a person’s user visual experience with a specific product/tool, often pertaining to a computer application/website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Approach</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Outlines the specific process used to execute the design and development.</p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <li><strong>Design Thinking:</strong> General human-centered methodology of discover, design, prototype, test, implement and repeat. Very collaborative and iterative with a goal to develop something of real value to end users that they will also find useful.</li>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Customer service is a key part of customer experience, but the two are not the same.</p>
                    <div class="usa-grid">
                        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
                            <p><strong>Customer service</strong> is an event that happens between a customer and a service provider, at a specific time and place, and is responsive to customer needs. It’s the advice you get, the help you receive. Good customer service is focused on making specific interactions positive and effective. Typically, customer service represents a single touchpoint in the customer’s broader experience with a service. Customer service can be interchanged with ‘customer care’.</p>
                        </div> <!-- /.usa-width-one-third -->
                        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
                            <p><strong>Customer experience</strong> is the sum of a person’s involvement with a brand or an agency. It encompasses all their interactions in different places, via different channels, and over time. Customer experience is about a person’s perception of their experience and their relationship with the service provider whether or not that is an accurate assessment. It’s about how they feel, and what they do as a result.</p>
                        </div> <!-- /.usa-width-one-third -->
                        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
                            <p><strong>Customer satisfaction</strong> is a measure of the customer’s experience with a service or transaction.</p>
                        </div> <!-- /.usa-width-one-third -->
                    </div> <!-- /.usa-grid -->
                    <p>Designing a good customer experience requires considering the customer’s whole journey with a service from start to finish, including before and after they come to you for service.</p>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Customer Experience Scope</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">A customer’s experience can be narrow or broad in scope, so the focus of CX analysis can be applied at different tiers. To create the best customer experience, you should determine the scope of the customer’s journey even if you can only focus on a portion of it.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Most readily observable, a customer interacts directly with the organization at the <strong>program</strong> tier, for instance at specific touchpoints with a service center, website, or application. Examples include obtaining a loan, getting a permit, and paying an invoice. However even when focused on a single program, there typically is interplay with other programs to deliver a complete customer experience.</li>
                        <li>Customer transactions also take place at the <strong>agency</strong> tier, across multiple programs or groups within a single agency. Examples include a Veteran informing several VA benefit programs about a change in address; or onboarding a new employee who needs support from Human Resources, a laptop from Information Technology and a badge from Security.</li>
                        <li>To complete certain transactions, a customer may need <strong>cross-agency</strong> coordination and interaction, for instance, among federal, state, and local governments and commercial companies. For example, a Service Member transitioning out of service might need medical records from the Department of Defense, benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs and job assistance from the Department of Labor.</li>
                    </ol>

           <h2>Practice</h2>
           <p class="intro">In this section you’ll find plays to help you get started, even if you have limited resources and support. The guidance includes how to select the right project, establish common goals and expectations, and identify your customers and their characteristics so you can understand their experience. Document everything along the way and share your work and findings with leadership to help prioritize solutions to improve the customer experience. Finally, as your experience and practice grows, keep a service catalog to help others understand what your team can offer and the value it brings.</p>

                <h3 class="first">Case Study</h3>
                <p>In the fall of 2016, Veterans Experience Office (VEO) in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) embarked on a research project to understand how veterans experience their outpatient healthcare. The goal was to establish an end-to-end definition of patient experience. To get here, VEO identified a set of Veteran personas, and together with VHA, conducted a discovery effort, interviewing nearly 100 veterans across multiple geographies, from various genders, races, life stages, military branches, and eras of service. The Human-centered Design research captured the voices and perspectives of veterans in their own words. The design team, together with stakeholders, used the large amount of qualitative data to identify patterns and insights. The team synthesized these findings into the VA Patient Experience Journey Map. The map represents a common set of moments that veterans experience, including Moments that Matter, Bright Spots, and Pain Points. With the map and insights, VHA could identify priority areas to improve the veteran patient experience. Among other things, this work led to the national Patient Experience initiative which is poised to transform the care experience across 152 VA healthcare systems across the United States. In addition, this has led to the development of survey questions based on our veterans feedback to determine if the services that they received was effective, easy, and emotionally resonate. This provides the VA the ability to hold itself accountable to the voice of the veterans and their families, and what matters most to them.</p>

                <h3>Key Question</h3>
                <p>Which projects can show high value with the least effort and cost?</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Follow the energy to find the path of least resistance:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>high visibility initiatives leadership is concentrating on</li>
                        <li>low hanging fruit (i.e. easiest/cheapest)</li>
                        <li>opportunities to find cost savings (e.g. consolidating similar surveys)</li>
                        <li>nagging customer issues</li>
                        <li>existing metrics that could use a CX perspective.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Look for projects that have high customer impact, but low effort to get traction.</li>
                    <li>Start small and get quick wins – to gain confidence, build trust and generate momentum, it helps to focus on one or two customer needs instead of their entire journey, while you learn the techniques and develop expertise.</li>
                    <li>Get grounded – find projects that will have tangible, concrete results with which people can better identify.</li>
                </ol>

                    <p>When GSA’s Chief Customer Office was stood up, the team conducted a current state analysis of customer feedback at GSA. After assessing the amount of money spent on individual feedback efforts (e.g. surveys, Contact Centers), the team advocated to invest that same money more strategically. They used these funds to launch a single agency-wide survey platform, were able to provide value to individual managers and a more holistic baseline from which to launch a customer experience practice.</p>

                    <li>Determine where your stakeholders are largely focused: on technology, on business needs, or human resources. Often, your project will begin with a heavy emphasis on one of these and you may need to steer your stakeholders to rebalance these three elements.</li>
                    <li>Provide assurance to stakeholders the purpose of the activity is not to perform an audit of current operations, but rather simply to <strong>listen</strong>, above all else, to customers/staff about their experiences.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a written agreement (e.g. engagement letter) describing the goals and approach of the activity, planned tasks and schedule, and level of participation for all parties.</li>
                    <li>Maintain flexibility to adjust the plan as you learn more about the customer.</li>

                    <p>The U.S. Department of State and GSA partnered to listen to their customers about the passport application and renewal process. Their research question was: “How can we improve the process to apply for or renew a U.S. passport to make it simpler and easier?” With this goal in mind, they set up online “suggestion boxes” and reached out to followers on social media and email subscribers to ask for ideas. Over 900 people offered suggestions and upvoted each others’ suggestions. Participants received emails with notifications when milestones were achieved during the project. The Department of State reviewed the recommendations and responded to each recommendation with a course of action they would take.

                    <p>USA.gov defined personas to represent the behavior for seeking different information on the site, such as finding information to complete a transaction, or learn more about a specific topic or general topic, or to locate contact information. Their process to define the personas took about two weeks and involved a range of stakeholders. These personas will allow USA.gov to do some journey mapping and in-person customer research to better understand their customers and their behaviors, to be equipped in developing a better website.

                <h2>Walk in Your Customer’s Shoes</h2>
                <h3>Key Question</h3>
                <p>What does a customer experience and feel while accessing your program/service across multiple channels?</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Develop a customer journey map for your program/service, including activities and touchpoints with your agency, and highlighting pain points, points of delight, moments of truth, and the customer’s emotional state. Be sure the journey map addresses service recovery to understand what the customer experiences when there are unexpected outcomes.</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To build further empathy and understand the entire customer experience, consider also developing a broader journey map that describes the overall objective the customer has, of which your program may be just one step. The broader journey may even include other agencies. For example, the journey a new business owner takes with an agency to obtain a permit is just one piece of a broader journey that includes obtaining licenses, finding and building out space, having inspections, getting insurance, hiring employees, etc.</li>
                        <li>For a deeper dive, consider blending the journey map with your business process map to demonstrate the full design required to deliver the service depicted in the journey.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Review existing customer feedback, both qualitative (e.g. surveys, interviews, roundtables, etc.), and quantitative (e.g. website analytics) to learn your customer’s preferences directly and indirectly.</li>
                    <li>Keep detailed documentation of your work at each step: what you did and how you did it, as a reference for future efforts and to spread knowledge of your activities.</li>
                    <li>Hold retrospectives after each activity for continuous improvement by capturing what went well and what needs work.</li>

                    <p>GSA and the Customer Experience CoE team partnered with the USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) to understand the experience of producers and service center staff in applying for and processing direct farm loan applications. The team conducted interviews and ethnographic observations with over 40 subject matter experts and employees in Washington DC and at six service centers, and almost 40 producers in six states. Through this research, the CX CoE team built a customer journey map that reflects the experience, pain points and moments of delight of producers and loan officers as they move through a typical application. The team also hosted four workshops with stakeholders to guide the research, update the customer journey map, vet important findings, and develop recommended solutions to improve the customer experience.

                    <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs found that 30% of customers calling into the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) were hanging up in the IVR system. Leadership was looking for an economical way of resolving this issue. When redesigning the IVR, the team discovered callers were hanging up because they preferred to speak with a human agent. Since the IVR system did not provide any prompts to be routed to speak to someone, these callers would abandon. To act on these findings, the new IVR system was designed to provide callers a prompt to be routed to an agent, and the number of callers hanging up in the IVR was reduced to just 5%. The mindset of putting the customer first and involving customers in the design allowed for a simple and cost-effective solution to the problem.</p>

           <h2>Measure</h2>
           <p class="intro">In this section, you’ll find plays to produce numbers that demonstrate your success and show the impact of your work. Whether using qualitative or quantitative measures, be sure to capture the right metrics that are meaningful, useful and tell a story. Good analytics is about developing key insights and making better decisions. Equally important is to be transparent – share the metrics to provide more visibility about the team successes. And finally, review metrics periodically to determine if they are still effective or need adjusting.</p>
           <div class="box case-study">
                <h3 class="first">Case Study</h3>
                <p>At the Department of Agriculture, the Data Analytics and Contact Center Centers of Excellence (CoEs) worked to streamline the data collection, reporting, and follow-up processes associated with “Tell Sonny”, a web-based platform and phone contact line for individuals to submit comments or inquiries across all USDA agencies and programs. Since launch, “Tell Sonny” received over 800 responses in the form of questions or feedback. What started as a basic prototype evolved into an important aspect of the Department’s focus on customer experience by incorporating improved dashboards, automating data collection, enhancing the web form for feedback, consolidating reporting, and employing a comment classification algorithm. Using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis, “Tell Sonny” comments are categorized and made automatically available for real time agency follow up. The next step is to allow agencies to add their responses to “Tell Sonny” comments using CRM tools like MS Dynamics, and based on sensitivity, these responses will be made available in the dashboards to reflect a full history of customer feedback.</p>

                <h3>Key Question</h3>
                <p>Are you asking customers the right questions and collecting the right metrics in the right way? Are your efforts making a difference for the customer?</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Review your <strong>goals</strong> and work backwards to identify metrics that measure progress towards those goals. For inspiration, look at:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The ‘moments that matter’ in the customer’s journey to help validate the impact of any efforts to improve the customer experience affecting those portions of the journey.</li>
                        <li>‘Failure demand’, such as spikes in calls to the contact center, where customers have self-identified pain points in their experience.</li>
                        <li>Your agency’s defined performance metrics and/or CAP goals.</li>
                        <li>The OMB A-11 circular for recommended customer experience metrics.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Make the metric <strong>relevant</strong> by associating it with a specific customer transaction, not just about the customer’s relationship with your agency.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the metric to keep data <strong>unbiased</strong>. For example, customer satisfaction is influenced by the nature of the activity – paying taxes will have lower satisfaction score than visiting national parks – so ask questions about the process instead of the outcome (e.g. Did you understand the requirements? How easy was the process? Were agents pleasant/helpful? Were issues resolved in a timely manner? Did you understand the factors that impacted your outcome? Did you trust the individuals you worked with?)</li>
                    <li>Keep the metric <strong>simple</strong> so it can be easily understood, tell a clear story, and enable decision makers to interpret readily what actions can be taken to reach the corresponding goal. For most effectiveness, keep surveys simple – ask few questions and ask straightforward questions.</li>
                    <li>Assign an <strong>owner</strong> to each metric, because without accountability, the metric is meaningless.</li>
                    <li>Clarify the <strong>action</strong>(s) that can be taken to make improvements based on the outcome of a metric (e.g. an increase or decrease in value). There is no reason to measure something if you can’t change the outcome.</li>
                    <li>Decide how often the metric will be updated. The more <strong>timely</strong> the metric, the more effective any actions related to it will be.</li>
                    <li>To assure trust in the data, have a means the capture <strong>reference</strong> information about each metric, such as: when last updated, from which system(s), how it was calculated, etc.</li>
                    <li>Find the best <strong>source</strong> for your metric:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Qualitative methods like surveys and social media posts.</li>
                        <li>Quantitative methods like website analytics and contact center data.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>For each metric, establish a baseline for comparison with future results to understand how initiatives are impacting customer experience.</li>
                    <li>Identify a way to have frequent “pulse checks” to understand how initiatives you undertake to improve customer experience impact customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Find opportunities to integrate customer feedback data from other channels, programs and business areas to provide a more rounded view of the customer experience (i.e. “Voice of the Customer”).</li>

                    <p>When Bing was trying to optimize their search engine towards the target metric they set (i.e. maximize searches per user), instead of developing features users preferred, they developed features that required users to perform more searches to find what they were seeking. Not surprisingly, this caused users to abandon Bing for other, more efficient search engines. Once Bing recognized they had established the wrong metric, they modified their target metric to reduce the number of queries per session for a user, and maximize the number of sessions per user. Once Bing agreed on the right metric, the search engine improved, resulting in a marked increase in the number of users, allowing Bing to become profitable.

                    <p>To position the USDA to be in alignment with the newly amended OMB A-11 circular, which boosted focus on customer experience across the federal government, the Data Analytics Center of Excellence (CoE) developed prototype feedback user interface and dashboard to capture and report on the specific questions outlined in the circular. The USDA aims to use the prototype to enhance websites to include the customer level feedback prescribed by the OMB A-11. The dashboard will enable USDA leadership to learn which aspects of customer experience need additional attention and make business decisions based on accumulated customer feedback data.

           <h2>Grow</h2>
           <p class="intro">In this section you’ll find plays that help you grow and sustain a successful CX practice, including assessing current capabilities to identify gaps and growth opportunities, developing relationships with leadership and like-minded people, creating a vision, obtaining skilled staff and funding, and infusing customer experience thinking throughout the agency. However, all the pieces do not have to be in place or fully mature to get started, and some elements may be more applicable than others to your organization. Start small, be deliberate, and build wisely as you stabilize your efforts.</p>

                <h3 class="first">Case Study</h3>
                <p>In 2014, GSA formed a team to focus on improving the interactions between the agency and its customers – the first agency-wide Customer Experience Office in the Federal Government. As a small, centralized resource for the agency, the mission was to use customer data to drive more effective business decisions. The team began by building relationships with stakeholders to show how focusing on CX can yield real results. Initial projects aimed to deliver small, quick wins and included centralizing and redesigning surveys to reduce the survey burden on customers, developing an action planning process to address customer feedback, and producing journey maps for each of the Federal Acquisition Service's business lines to identify major customer pain points. Eventually, the office offered training opportunities to build the CX capacity of the agency through design workshops. As the team matured, it established a vision that included these offerings: customer research and understanding, strategy and products, capacity building, and pilots. In 2016, the office was recognized officially by the Federal Government with an annual budget. Through a combination of building allegiances with the right stakeholders, defining a clear strategy, and hiring CX-minded staff, the office is now able to support GSA in improving broader journeys, such as international travel, that involve multiple agencies.</p>

                    <p>US Census Bureau in 2011 wanted to make it easier to modernize its technology through the agency. In 2014, they established the Center for Applied Technology (CAT Lab), an open space on a lower level of their building staffed with 7 technology and software experts. The intake process consisted of a simple, open invitation to enter the CAT lab and have a conversation about a technology challenge. One Census Bureau analyst came to the lab because of a struggle to manage thousands of survey respondents, which was a manual process that would take weeks. Accordingly, the lab co-developed a solution to automate the survey analysis process.</p>

            <h2>Keys to Success</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Starting with small, but impactful projects that demonstrate value and build trust and momentum.</li>
                <li>A practicing model that emulates industry best practices, adapted to government constraints.</li>
                <li>An approach that involves listening to the customer. Saves time, energy and money because you end up building what the customer actually wants.</li>
                <li>Documenting everything you do and sharing your progress liberally with stakeholders and leadership for transparency and to gain visibility.</li>
                <li>A nimble and iterative approach that is responsive to changing needs and priorities.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with others who share an interest in CX within and outside your organization.</li>
                <li>Offering learning opportunities for those who wish to know more about CX.</li>
                <li>Guiding leadership and staff to develop a customer-centered culture, by sharing a common focus on the customer experience and a pervasive sentiment that the customer is your top priority.</li>
                <li>Developing performance-based incentives for employees to adopt customer experience-centric practices.</li>
                <li>Negotiating various tensions that can pull you off track or towards more challenging paths:<br>
                    <div class="box">
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li><strong>Structure (Leadership and Bureaucracy):</strong> Leadership support will stand an office up, organizational buy-in will allow it to flourish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data (Quantitative and Qualitative):</strong> Quantitative data tells you what to look at, qualitative data tells you how to act on it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stakeholders (Internal and External):</strong> Incorporate input from both external stakeholders (i.e. Veterans, their families, caregivers, survivors) and internal stakeholders (i.e. VA employees) to form a more complete picture of the status and develop a way forward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Approaches (Public and Private):</strong> Bridge the gap between private and public sector best practices to create a well-rounded point of view.</li>
                            <li><strong>Innovation (Enterprise and Local):</strong> Create a balanced environment in which all levels (granular and high-level) can contribute their views from their unique perspective, so the organization can benefit from innovation while staying focused on a common future.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implementation (Ideas and Implementation):</strong> Think big, but be aware of the organizational environment around you and how to successfully operate in that environment. Organizational models are not one size fits all, and what may work for some organizations may not be the best fit for others.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partnership (Intra and Inter-agency):</strong> Leverage the experience and expertise of other government offices when needed, to strengthen and diversify your internal capabilities. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when a successful blueprint already exists.</li>

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>One of the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals identified in the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) is <strong>improving customer experience (CX)</strong>. The goal is “to transform the customer experience by improving the usability and reliability of our Federal Government’s most critical digital services; create measurable improvements in customer satisfaction by using the principles and practices proven by leading private sector organizations; increase trust in the Federal Government by improving the experience citizens and businesses have with Federal services whether online, in-person, or via phone; and leverage technology to break down barriers and increase communication between Federal agencies and the citizens they serve.”</p>
                <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Centers of Excellence (COEs) were established to accelerate IT modernization to improve the citizen experience, improve outcomes and reduce legacy IT spending across the government. The Customer Experience COE specifically aims to demonstrate the business value of customer experience as a discipline, work with agencies to develop a better understanding of their customers and their needs and help translate those findings into actions that create outstanding experiences.</p>
                <p>This playbook was prepared by the GSA CX CoE in support of the PMA and CAP goals.</p>
