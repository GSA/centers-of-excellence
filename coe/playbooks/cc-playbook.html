                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The GSA Center of Excellence (CoE) for Contact Center of the Future developed a playbook consisting of 15 plays that Government Agencies should consider when looking to modernize, optimize and consolidate contact centers. The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals showcase the Government’s focus on improving the customer experience with accessing information and services. Contact centers play a crucial role in an agency’s CAP goal strategy, since they are a critical touch point to understanding the customer experience and identifying opportunities that can be fixed or improved.</p>
                    <p>The plays are organized as a step-by-step task list, beginning with understanding customer experience and ending with ensuring changes last. The playbook provides an overview of key questions and topics to consider for implementing each play. This high-level view will enable agencies across government to operationalize learnings drawn from CoE discovery efforts at USDA.</p>

                <h2>Understand the Current Customer Experience and “Real” Nature of the Work</h2>
                <p>As you begin to understand the experience your customers (e.g., farmers, ranchers, producers, foresters, etc.) are having with the people and systems delivered by your agency, you can identify areas that will need attention and further analysis. It’s also important to determine the appetite for change within your agency (e.g., incremental change vs. transformational change). If the agency is a citizen-facing agency, more than likely you deliver services and information to citizens online or via the phone, email, or chat through contact centers.</p>
                <p>This transitions you from managing people to managing the system--from end-to-end. You go from “making the numbers” to “serving the customers.” It’s important to remove the causes of the failure work demand which will improve customer service and reduce costs.</p>

                <h2>Understand Your Customers</h2>
                <p>Truly understanding your customers and what matters to them is at the core of providing outstanding experiences. If you don’t know what the customers’ expectations are, you don’t know if you’ve met or exceeded those expectations. In the private sector, companies that know how and when to use the wide array of research tools available have big competitive advantage in generating insights that lead to growth. In the government, understanding your customers requires you to understand what motivates them, what matters to them and and how they make decisions. This allows you to serve them without wasting valuable resources on things that don’t matter to them.</p>

                <h2>Understand Your Workforce</h2>
                <p>Contact centers are staffed by either government employees or contracted out. There can also be technology within contact centers that help to answer and route calls. When trying to manage contact centers across an enterprise, by understanding the complexity and topic of the calls and the staff answering the calls and managing the operations gives you insights into future strategies. For example, if most of the calls are complex in nature pertaining to the mission of the agency, it may be difficult to contract out those calls. On the other hand, some agencies outsource contact centers that handle fairly complex technical and medical issues. If a large percentage of the calls are asking routine and low complexity questions, the answers to those calls can be automated. The critical component is a knowledge base that clearly answers the questions to the most frequently asked questions in plain language.</p>
                <p>Training is an important component to managing the workforce in a contact center. In some cases, an independent quality assurance program combined with training is used to maintain the level of proficiency and professionalism needed to perform at peak.</p>

                <h2>Understand Your Employees</h2>
                <p>Because customer experience is based on the interactions that your customers have with every program, initiative, service and employee, having employees that are “ready and willing” to deliver service is a must. This is a critical component to changing the culture in an agency and becoming truly customer-focused. Leading customer-focused companies have employees that are engaged and motivated to deliver outstanding customer experience. They understand the vision that the company’s products and services are supposed to have on their customers’ lives. They are also empowered by the leadership to do the right thing in bringing good service to the customers.</p>

                <h2>Measure the Contact Center’s Service: Continually Monitor and Improve</h2>
                <p>The purpose of monitoring measures is twofold: first, to assess the customer’s satisfaction with the service provided by the contact center and two, to ensure that it operates as efficiently and effectively as possible. In addition to customer satisfaction measures (outside in) and key performance indicators (inside out), it’s important to measure the type of calls being received. These measures are important to driving an outstanding experience and containing costs, and should be continually monitored to determine the operational efficiency of the contact centers. As the performance is monitored and measured, you should assess what actions need to be taken to improve a specified performance issue or customer pain point.</p>

                <p>Innovation can mean introducing new types of technology that disrupts the current way that the contact center operates. Technology can make agents more efficient, provide analytics that can result in improved processes. Innovation can be introduced by an agency in the processes they use to manage the contact center and leverage the data across channels. Innovation can also be introduced in the contracting process. </p>
                <p>Continuous improvement can only be successful by experimenting on technologies to implement to improve processes. Test and learn initiatives are small scale implementations or experiments using new technology to evaluate the feasibility, time, cost, and challenges to determine whether it’s possible to move to a full-scale project.It’s best to have a clear idea about how you want to create and evaluate the pilot.</p>

                <h2>Incorporate Contracting Best Practices for Best-in-Class Digital Contact Center Services</h2>
                <p>Contracting for contact centers can present a myriad of complexities because many agencies want to acquire a company that can provide the entire contact center products and services (i.e., contact center agents, facilities, technology infrastructure, telecom infrastructure, analytics). When contracting for contact centers, there are many things to consider:</p>
                <ol class="number-list">
                    <li>What contract would you use to be able to acquire the products and services you need?</li>
                    <li>The type of contract (e.g., firm fixed price or cost plus) would be the most advantageous. Different contract types can be used for different parts of the contract.</li>
                    <li>The type of requirements to be released (e.g., statement of objectives, performance based contract, performance work statement).</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>What are the type of products and services you need (e.g., full contact center, infrastructure, customer service representatives, test and learn initiatives, training, quality assurance, etc.)?</li>
                    <li>What experience are you driving for each component of the contact center?</li>
                    <li>Are there some tasks where you can define the requirement clearly and award on a fixed price basis?</li>

                <h2>Create and Leverage a Knowledge Management System</h2>
                <p>Knowledge is one of the critical success factors to providing outstanding service to customers. Knowledge management articles are a way to document the frequently asked questions. Benefits to the government include:</p>
                <ol class="number-list">
                    <li>Provides flexibility in future customer strategies such as the implementation of artificial intelligence</li>

                </ol>
                <p>When determining how your contact center representatives are going to provide answers to solve the numerous types of questions to solve your customers’ problems, you need to understand what knowledge is and how to create a system to manage. To begin, start with the frequently asked questions that are online across all the contact centers and digital properties. Regardless of the current technology being used, migrating knowledge from one technology to another requires reconfiguring and editing the content. The time it takes to create a knowledge management system should not be underestimated.</p>

                <h2>Ensure that the Changes Last</h2>
                <p>When modernizing, optimizing or consolidating contact centers, you will encounter many places where everyone wants to maintain the “status quo.” People are always sensitive to how any changes will impact their job, roles, and responsibilities. Leadership should assess the culture of the organization to determine the changes to make their citizen services strategies a success. Any changes to a contact center strategy will probably impact their online and in-person strategy. Some of the issues that could present change management issues include:</p>
                <ol class="number-list">
                    <li>Implementing new technology which results in learning new ways of operating.</li>

                    <li>Changing the customer journey in terms of new phone numbers to call; there will be changes to digital properties as well as anything that touches the customers.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>All of these changes require buy-in from all levels within the agency and the need to justify the changes in terms of customer experience and the return on investment (i.e., efficiency and effectiveness).</p>
