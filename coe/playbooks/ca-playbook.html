                    <p>Modern IT moves quickly- agile delivery of features makes the people that use systems happy and swift patching protects systems and data. To get these results, your agency will need to think, work and buy technology differently. Cloud adoption, if done correctly, can be a rallying point to modernize processes, security and workforce skills.</p>
                    <p>The Cloud Adoption COE assists with the analysis of current systems and applications to provide recommendations for planning migration to the cloud, including balancing tactical “lift and shift” imperatives with more strategic “uplift and shift” possibilities. Using an agile and flexible framework the CoE will accelerate adoption across the executive branch enterprise.</p>

                <h2>Business Alignment</h2>
                <p>Many executives still believe that cloud computing is about technology. It’s not. Cloud is a new model for consuming and delivering information technology services.</p>
                <p>Successful cloud adoption requires aligning the business value with technological transformation strategy and implementation strategy. Because IT modernization projects are about enabling business practices, the pool of relevant stakeholders is much wider than traditional IT initiatives.</p>
                <p>Shifts in cloud markets and technologies, price pressures from oversight and compliance, and demand for more cloud-based service features, quality and bandwidth combine to make this increasingly challenging. These challenges are driving Federal IT transformation, with the most common objectives being:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Cost Optimization</li>
                    <li>Faster Time to Market</li>
                    <li>Assured Quality</li>
                    <li>Effective Security and Control</li>
                    <li>Better Customer Experience</li>
                    <li>Future Readiness</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Centralization of cloud services provides a real opportunity to meet all of an agency’s transformation objectives.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Agency Leadership should hold meetings to hone in on a few objectives to frame the cloud migration work going forward</li>

                <h2>Align and Enable Stakeholders</h2>
                <p>Coming together in new ways to pursue greater communication, collaboration, and coordination - the goal is to create a system that works for all stakeholders.</p>
                <p>A critical foundational component of such a system is stakeholder alignment. In other words, before they can work together more effectively, agency stakeholders must agree on the high level goals they are working toward and these goals should be aligned with business objectives and the overall agency mission.</p>
                <p>There needs to be clear goals set by business owners so that business owners are incentivised to all the changes necessary to improve processes and work in new ways.</p>
                <p>Cloud computing, with its ability to connect information, systems, and people, provides the means to not only support collaborative decision making but also to create a level of coordination that can transform Federal IT processes.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have a kickoff meeting for agency leadership to share the vision of how cloud adoption will enhance mission delivery with a wide group of stakeholders and implementers.</li>
                    <li>Hold follow up workshops that focus on different aspects of cloud migration. This should refine goals and involve business owners and technical perspectives.</li>
                    <li>Make sure security and the ATO process is ready for new tools, products and services that come with a cloud platform.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Where will the budget for initial cloud investment come from?</li>

                <h2>Identify an Empowered Leader</h2>
                <p>In a small agency, this might be an individual, in a larger agency this will need to be a cloud team with a leader that has significant support from senior leadership.</p>
                <p>Organizations that successfully leverage cloud do so with a business model that balances the following:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>A variable, scalable, and elastic technology service consumption model</li>
                    <li>A variable (but customer-driven) business model</li>
                    <li>An economic model that directly links business benefits to product/service delivery costs</li>
                    <li>A self-service approach to building and scaling resources</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once there are leaders for cloud migration, stakeholders need to support the efforts by reaching out to other key enablers for cloud adoption success across the agency. Beyond identification of these enablers, the cloud team - in collaboration with the OCIO should clearly communicate roles, responsibilities, and expectations - aligned with the particular subject matter expertise/sphere of influence of each potential key enabler for success.</p>
                <p>Empowered leaders need the space and authority to make sure business practices are adaptive. If all business practices stay the same, you will duplicate your current systems and not get the full benefits of a cloud migration.</p>

                <h2>System Inventory &amp; Rationalization</h2>
                <p>One of the core tenets of InfoSec and cloud hygiene more generally is keeping a comprehensive, detailed inventory of your systems and applications. Your system inventory should be kept up-to-date as a living document that may be accessed quickly and easily during a security event. You can do this manually or (even better) you can create and maintain inventories using software. This is an opportunity to improve visibility into your assets by implementing industry standards, such as technology business management (TBM).</p>
                <p>Most agencies have a small subset of systems that process their most sensitive data, such as financial information, protected health information, and personally identifiable information (PII). As agencies conduct their inventories, they should ensure awareness of these systems and applications in particular. Ultimately, the most important thing is for agencies to make the inventory process regular, disciplined, and methodical.</p>
                <p>In order to develop the most effective possible solution to a challenge, you have to understand the full scope of the problem as well as you can. If you have a detailed and accurate inventory, creating a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that articulates the current computing environment, you will be better prepared to develop the optimal solutions, respond to potential vulnerabilities, and position emerging technologies to address any new challenges that lie on the horizon.</p>
                <p>With this assessment, you will want to work with stakeholders to identify cloud ready apps, areas that need improvement outside of the cloud migration project and opportunities to consolidate and retire apps.</p>

                <h2>Develop Cloud Migration Plan</h2>
                <p>Once an agency decides that cloud migration is appropriate, it will be best to implement the solution step-by-step to avoid possible gaps. It is important not only to take into account opportunities and threats but forecast the specific outcomes of this decision.</p>
                <p>Here are the recommended steps to planning a powerful cloud migration strategy:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><strong>Cloud assessment</strong> - Planning costs + assessing architecture + evaluating security</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof of concept</strong> - Studying solutions(s) + establishing a pilot + gaining support within the organization</li>
                    <li><strong>Data and app migration</strong> - Leveraging various storage alternatives + conducting migration itself</li>
                    <li><strong>Leverage the cloud</strong> - Auto-scaling + automatization + achieving elasticity and high availability</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimization</strong> - Taking care of utilization, controlling and efficiency, improving performance and re-engineering</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Picking cloud providers can be daunting. To be successful in procuring cloud services, one must have requirements that are clear, create service level agreements (SLA) which reflect these requirements and be measurable in order to validate the delivery of these services along with their performance and remedies. As part of the decision making framework for moving to the cloud, having data on measurable capabilities, for example - quality of service, availability and reliability, give the cloud service customer the tools and opportunity to make informed choices and to gain an understanding of the service being delivered.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Conduct market research on the different products and services</li>
                    <li>Assess what kinds of technical needs your apps have</li>
                    <li>Benchmark your availability and reliability and compare your current situation to cloud solutions</li>
                    <li>Create clear metrics to track your success</li>
                    <li>Identify cloud ready apps that have large business value. Systems that are not 12-factor apps (for example systems with a lot of state) will be harder to migrate.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Key Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What cloud services meet Agency needs?</li>
                    <li>What is the level of support your agency will need from a cloud provider?</li>
                    <li>Will there need to be additional vendor and FTE support for migration?</li>
                    <li>Do you have the resources to set up and fine tune configurations with infrastructure as a service (IAAS) or would it be better to save time by leveraging a platform as a service (PAAS)?</li>

                <h2>Strategic Communications</h2>
                <p>Agencies require a targeted communications strategy to help staff understand how and why more IT systems will move into the cloud. This can include shutting down old systems that may be familiar to employees. They may feel uneasiness, especially about how they will learn to operate new systems. They might not realize that cloud computing will mean that they will learn to use a new graphic user interface to manipulate data pushed in from your organization’s older IT systems. Above all, remember to listen to the people that are on the front lines interacting with these new systems.</p>
                <p>Moving to the cloud is a necessity to succeed today and moving forward. Pushback from within an agency is inevitable because of a natural resistance to change. Quickly and visibly addressing concerns early in a project can help build trust. It is vital to communicate and reiterate the business value of the work and how it enhances mission delivery. The COE will collaborate with agency leadership to explain all of the good that can come from this change to drive increased adoption and consumption of cloud alternatives.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure the business benefits that have been articulated up to this point are periodically reiterated to agency at large</li>

                <h2>Pilot Solutions</h2>
                <p>Once the work begins you will learn a tremendous amount about what works or doesn’t work for your systems. Using an agile approach reduces risk and increases quality. It is important to deliver working code with real value in every sprint.</p>
                <p>Start with some lightweight prototyping. This will validate your assumptions or quickly uncover issues in process and technology.</p>
                <p>Cloud migrations are a critical opportunity to introduce best practices. There is a wide range of opportunity to improve security, business and technology across the board. You will want to make sure you are increasing your frequency of deployment. You will want to make sure you have version control and start treating you configuration and infrastructure as code. This is a great time to add or improve application testing as part of your continuous automation and automated deploys.</p>
                <p>Try to get an ATO at the beginning of the process, rather than near the end. Security and compliance is an essential part of the cloud migration. The ways that cloud computing is secured requires a paradigm shift that requires a lot of support from CISO and security leadership.</p>
                <p>Remember that best practices are not just about tools and technology, take the time to communicate to people about these new ways of working.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prototype key infrastructure areas to validate assumptions and surface unforeseen problems</li>

                <p>Once you have a working app, make sure to budget time to make necessary improvements.</p>
                <p>During the migration process, take the time to perform a retrospective after migrating or improving each system. Constantly reassess what is working and not working so business practices, security and technological implementation constantly improves.</p>
                <p>Prioritize additional app migrations and optimizations. Some features may not be needed immediately but will be necessary once you start migrating more complicated apps. For example auto-scaling will be needed for achieving elasticity for high availability apps that need to meet larger demands.</p>
                <p>As your implementation becomes more sophisticated, you will be able to focus on taking care of utilization, efficiency, improving performance and refactoring.</p>
