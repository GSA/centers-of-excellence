                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Infrastructure Optimization Center of Excellence will assist the strategic planning activities of federal agencies through development of a unified and optimized IT infrastructure, and by leveraging federally owned data centers, cloud computing services, and commercial data centers (e.g. co-location).</p>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The objective of the playbook is to assist agencies in their development and implementation of infrastructure optimization, integrated cloud computing, and data center consolidation strategies. This playbook is not a one size fits all solution, or a comprehensive guide to modernization success at your agency. We hope that agencies will utilize the plays, checklists, and key questions within the playbook to enhance their modernization efforts. The playbook includes required process workflows, standard operating checklists and recommendations that should shape a consistent response in an agency’s journey of IT modernization.</p>

                <h2>Define the Objectives, Roles, and Responsibilities for Infrastructure Optimization</h2>
                <p>To successfully optimize an agency’s infrastructure portfolio, it is important to start by prioritizing the process objectives; such as reducing costs, building IT capabilities, improving customer satisfaction, and mitigating risk. These objectives will help guide the optimization initiatives that are pursued and what message is communicated to the broader organization.</p>
                <p>The agency should then define the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders who will be involved in the planning and execution of the initiatives. This analysis often takes the form of a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) diagram, which defines the exact roles and responsibilities of stakeholders against the planning activities to be supported. Without such an analysis, there is no clear delineation of responsibilities. Alignment of objectives, roles, and responsibilities will form the foundation of an optimization initiative that enables agencies to move on to subsequent plays.</p>

                <h2>Conduct a Data Center Discovery Assessment</h2>
                <p>One of of the objectives of the data center discovery assessment is to compile an IT asset inventory that includes an exhaustive list of applications hosted in the agency’s data centers that may need to be optimized and migrated. From this list, one can gather enough information to enable application rationalization and determine configurations for future hosting solutions. An IT asset inventory is also important for progress tracking and for estimating savings and workload during and after the optimization process.</p>
                <p>A complete inventory can be developed by compiling information from pre-existing inventories, lists, and records. For example, server inventories provide lists of physical and virtual servers that can be used to determine space requirements for co-location solutions and instance requirements for service solutions. A software inventory that is likely already in possession allows for current software licenses to be categorized and provides determination of abilities to migration to a new hosting solution. Finally, a physical asset inventory will help determine the amount of racks and equipment that may need to be transported or disposed of during a migration.</p>
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compile a complete inventory of all applications, servers, software licenses, data sources and their dependencies</li>
                    <li>Provide a tool to enable automated collection of network data about application/server communication</li>
                    <li>Build a cost baseline for each data center that includes all of its asset categories (e.g., rent, power, operations and maintenance (O&amp;M), server labor, server hardware, server software, storage, data center labor, hosting infrastructure and hosting services.)</li>
                    <li>Validate the collected data with data center managers and other key stakeholders</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Key Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can the data collection process be standardized to ensure consistency and quality across the organization?</li>
                    <li>How can an agency ensure that it has an exhaustive list of its physical and virtual assets?</li>
                    <li>How does the portfolio optimization “bottoms-up” figure compare with the “top-down” cost summary?</li>
                    <li>If the costs of optimizing your portfolio are drastically different, how will the differences be reconciled?</li>
                    <li>Are there strategies that can be used in the future to automate the collection and maintenance of inventories?</li>

                <h2>Conduct Application Rationalization</h2>
                <p>The process of application rationalization involves the objective disposition of applications in an agency’s portfolio based on an evaluation of an application’s business value and technical vitality. Application rationalization seeks to first eliminate applications that are no longer needed or that provide low value relative to their cost. Applications that are retained can be dispositioned based on their capability and fit for a given environment (e.g., dedicated hosting, commercial cloud). Disposition of the portfolio provides the agency with a plan for its existing IT inventory, savings and cost avoidance opportunities, and identifies applications to be invested in and potentially candidates for migration to the cloud.</p>

                <h2>Consolidate Data Centers</h2>
                <p>By reducing the number of data centers via consolidations, organizations can reduce costs due to a smaller network and application infrastructure. The consolidation increases the control as it promotes optimization through transport, architecture and options to deploy more advanced protocols, and management strategies that maximize bandwidth utilization and performance of the network. The consolidation also reduces the number of physical sites and assets to manage. The lower number of sites means they are easier to physically secure and enterprise initiatives become far easier, less costly, and requires fewer resources. The disaster recovery solutions are also less daunting due to all the vital components residing in in one place, easing replication and failover initiation. Data center consolidation supports compliance efforts by promoting process and system automation and standardization. The automation captures the procedures and functions that are executed, and ensures compliance with relevant policies, regulations, standards, and quality of service metrics.</p>

                <h2>Achieve Operational Excellence</h2>
                <p>Achieving operational excellence means improving the performance or cost-efficiency of their IT operations. In the context of IT infrastructure, this often requires an organization to become more efficient in managing its resources, processes, and procurement. Agencies should determine whether the staff has the skills necessary to implement its strategic vision and create strategies to address any talent gaps. Furthermore, organization should look to centralize or pool similar roles at the appropriate organization level to match labor supply and incoming demand. From a process perspective, agencies should try to eliminate burdensome or low-value steps in their core IT processes (e.g., manual patching or server provisioning). Finally, the agency should practice demand management by only purchasing what is necessary (e.g., not overspecing on servers). Agencies should also optimize its sourcing process, acknowledge areas to optimize, rationalize, or reduce their financial spend based on target benchmarks.</p>

                <h2>Create an Agile Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>There are major shifts needed to become an agile infrastructure. Cross-functional product teams must own and specifically define items from the service catalog the infrastructure provides. These teams must fulfill requests for their services and improve service delivery by streamlining processes and engineering automated solutions. The engineering of the talent cultivation will provide an organization of well-rounded engineers who can focus on constantly learning new skills and the development of infrastructure products. Redesigning products using an agile approach eliminates unnecessary steps and improves the process, making the process highly effective and streamlined. All typical lean levers are utilized to ensure minimal to no waste in the system. The creation of end-to-end automation requires that the IT infrastructure focus on the development of standard consumable infrastructure products. Self-service / Application programming interface (API) driven and automated provisioning of standardized products should ensure scalability of configurations.</p>

                <h2>Ensure Ongoing Executive Reporting and Interaction</h2>
                <p>Regular reporting on the current progress of the optimization efforts will ensure that the leadership and the organization are aligned. Reporting will also enable to agencies to identify any issues or risks and rapidly escalate them to the appropriate source for resolution. Agencies will need to align on the most relevant metrics and build a dashboard for tracking. Most importantly, the information needs to be structured in a way that will allow decisions to be made and actions to be taken; reporting should not be done for reporting’s sake.</p>
