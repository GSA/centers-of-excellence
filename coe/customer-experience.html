            <h3 class="title"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/27/cx-update-7.html">An Overview of the Customer Experience (Cx) Coe Activities and Progress at USDA</a></h3>
            <p>The Customer Experience Center of Excellence (CX CoE) aims to improve the digital and human experiences of USDA customers—our nation’s agricultural producers, consumers, and users of public lands—using human-centered design, service design, user experience, and design thinking to identify and meet the core human needs at the heart of every customer’s interaction.</p>
            <p>Phase 1 began in April 2018, and the team used modern CX practices <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/2018/08/03/cx-update-4.html">including design-led field research</a> —we’ll talk more about CX research methods in upcoming posts) in a pilot to help USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) better understand the burdens faced by farmers, ranchers, and service center staff as they <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/index">direct farm loan applications</a>.</p>
            <p>For new producers, these burdens—a range of technology challenges, knowledge gaps, and process complexities—make an already-difficult application process even harder. Because these producers are new to the process, they don’t fully understand what their overall loan journey will look like. They’re faced with mysterious delays, strange terminology, and seemingly endless requirements for paperwork. All too often, something as simple as some missing data from a farm business plan or asset list can only be corrected by yet another long drive to a sometimes-distant service center. All this conspires to make the direct loans experience more stressful—and more costly—for new producers who are the least-equipped to absorb those costs.</p>
            <p>During our research, we conducted interviews, field observations, and workshops with dozens of producers and USDA employees in six states and Washington, DC. This enabled us to map the Farm Loans Customer Journey, 13 key findings, and related recommendations—including areas where USDA can develop solutions that both address the biggest pain points between producers and loan officers and preserve the unique, highly valued collaborative relationship between the two groups.</p>
            <p>You can see a full report of our work, including methods, resources, and other artifacts in the <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/farm-loans/index.html">USDA Direct Farms Loan Journey</a>. Our research revealed improvements that some service centers have already discovered and that need to be adapted and spread throughout the system. We also uncovered some relatively simple, low-cost solutions, that if skillfully applied at the right points of the loan process, could help relieve some of the biggest pain points faced by both producers and loan officers. For example, we're currently prototyping targeted digital and paper farm loan eligibility guides to help streamline the process for applicants, and help them better understand their entire loan journey with USDA, and the steps they need to take within it.</p>
            <p>During Phase 2 of the initiative, which kicked off in October 2018, the CX CoE team has been keeping up our momentum, following up on priorities identified in Phase 1, and partnering with USDA mission areas (and the other CoEs) to find additional high-impact USDA business challenges where we can apply CX methods to get better insights and build effective, customer-focused solutions./<p>
            <p>Along the way, we’re going to be helping USDA agencies understand, grow, and develop their own customer experience capabilities. Together, we can expand USDA’s ability to use CX to help USDA achieve its vision of becoming the most customer-focused department in the federal government and fulfill its goal to <a href="https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/strategic-goalsl">goal to "Do Right and Feed Everyone."</a></p>
            <p>Stay tuned as we talk more about our work, including sharing progress on our current round of projects, showing you how we’re working to grow USDA’s CX capabilities throughout the agency, and developing tools and techniques that you or your organization can adopt into efforts to improve your customers’ experiences.</p>

            <p>Customer service is a key part of customer experience, but the two are not the same.</p>
            <p><b>Customer service</b> is an event that happens between a customer and a service provider, at a specific time and place. It’s the advice you get, the help you receive. Customer service is responsive to a person’s needs at a place and point in time. Good customer service is focused on making specific interactions positive and effective.</p>
            <p><b>Customer experience</b> is the sum of a person’s involvement with a brand or an agency. It encompasses all their interactions in different places, via different channels, and over time. Customer experience is about how people perceive their relationship with the service provider. It’s about how they feel, and what they do as a result.</p>
            <p> On our part, designing good customer experiences requires us to consider the customer’s journey with our service from start to finish, even before they first come to us.</p>

            <h3 class="title"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2018/08/17/cx-update-5.html">Customer Journey Analysis for the USDA Direct Farm Loans Program</a></h3>
            <p>The Customer Experience Center of Excellence followed a customer journey mapping model for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to evaluate the experience of producers and service center staff in applying for and processing direct farm loan applications.</p>

            <p>We conducted interviews and ethnographic observations with over 40 FPAC subject matter experts and employees in Washington DC and at six service centers, and almost 40 producers in six states. We also hosted four workshops with stakeholders in Washington, DC to guide the research, update the customer journey map, vet important findings, and develop recommended solutions to improve the customer experience.</p>

            <p>Among the 13 key findings, the following were identified as the most impactful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Producers value in person interactions with Loan Officers</li>
                <li>Loan Officers deal with fragile and limited technology at service centers</li>
                <li>First-time borrowers need help understanding the entire loan process</li>
                <li>Producers find loan forms challenging</li>
                <li>Producers find the current loan limits constraining and inadequate to cover their needs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2018/08/03/cx-update-4.html">In the Field for Farm Loans Customer Research</a></h3>

            <div>
                <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/customer-experience/2018-05-15-Oklahoma.jpg" alt="Hollis, Oklahoma" class="img-responsive">
                <p class="caption">Hollis, Oklahoma</p>
            </div>
            <p>Driving through a landscape of stretched cotton fields and grasslands towards Hollis, Oklahoma was both mesmerizing and a refreshing reminder I was far from the traffic-ridden hustle of downtown DC. Located in the southwest corner of Oklahoma, Hollis could be considered a nondescript pass-through town on a cross-country drive, but for my fellow researcher and I, Hollis, a small town with a population just above 2,000 people, was a long-planned destination.</p>
            <p>We found ourselves in rural Oklahoma to understand from the perspective of local farmers what it’s like to obtain a USDA farm loan. Although not commonly known, ownership and operating loans are provided to small farmers by the USDA, and our core project was to improve the experience of the farmer as he or she completes the loan application process and moves through the administration lifecycle. We were visiting this countryside town for ethnographic research on USDA farm loans. Ethnographic research, or the study of people in their culture, is a core part of the Customer Experience Center of Excellence’s (CX CoE) approach to finding solutions that meet the needs of end customers.</p>
            <p>In and around Hollis, where farming is one of the mainstays of the region’s economy and livestock, wheat, and cotton are the key products, we met the USDA field office team and farmers who represented the diversity of USDA farm loan borrowers.</p>
            <p>We first met Simon, who had recently borrowed from the USDA. Simon, also a veteran, grew up helping on his family farm and returned to it after retiring from the military. We met him at his cattle farm, and he was kind enough to permit us to ride in his feeder truck around the 200-plus acres of his lot - we actually conducted our interview in the middle of the field. We learned about the difficulty he had in understanding eligibility requirements from the information on the loan application website. It was much easier when a loan officer walked him through the requirements and handed him an application packet that was tailored to his needs.</p>
            <p>When we did a solution prioritization activity with each of our interviewees, it was interesting to see that age and preference for digital solutions weren’t always correlated as we would expect them. Glenn, a young rancher and member of the Texas Cowboys Association, feared digital solutions will replace the personal relationship he has with his loan officer. Whereas Sarah, a farmer in her 50s and savvy with the Internet, longed for the option to be able to check her loan balance and payment information online without having to reach out to someone at the local service center, which to Sarah felt like an onerous process for both her and her loan officer.</p>
            <p>We also visited the regional USDA service center, which is a field office of the USDA that helps local farmers. At the service center, we spent quality time interviewing and following around Larry, the Farm Loan Manager, who had been at this USDA service center for over 30 years. He gets in to work at the crack of dawn and he lives by the mission of lender of first opportunity. If a farmer or rancher is in need of a loan and they can’t get it elsewhere, he will work his hardest to assist the farmer, even if it means securing a loan for a short period of time so that the farmer can get to a stable place. We also met Larry’s team of loan officers and program technicians who have figured out efficiencies, despite frequent and common failures in IT and telecom systems, to close loan applications and service them with the least amount of delays possible. We saw rooms and desks full of boxes from loan paperwork that limits their ability to grow the team without the option of being able to expand or relocate.</p>
            <p>Although our research wasn’t conducted in the most conventional of meeting spaces, our team and USDA learned more than we expected from working in the field (literally!).  We learned more about the USDA borrowers on their farms - even once working from the back of a pick-up truck - and in their homes on their kitchen-room tables than we could from a remote conference call all the way back in D.C.  The best place to understand a customer is in their natural environment, and that’s what we aimed to do.</p>
            <p>During our four days in Hollis, everyone we met was exceptionally kind and welcoming. Over the course of our research about USDA farm loans, our teams also traveled to Georgia, Oregon, New York, North Dakota, and Virginia. Through in-depth interviews, observation of their physical environment and solution prioritization exercises, we learnt about small farmers’ relationship with USDA and their experience of obtaining a loan through USDA. In the process, we uncovered insights, opportunities and unmet needs. The customer journey map that was produced as a result of this research helps teams working on farm loans and farmers.gov gain a shared understanding of the process and the ability to identify quickly where changes need to happen to alleviate pain points.</p>

Personas are research-based, archetypal representations of key customers that capture what we know about our audiences. They tell stories that guide decision-making and help us develop products that align with people’s attitudes, motivations, expectations, and behaviors and what would make their lives easier.</p>

            <p>Customer Journey Mapping (CJM) is intended to guide program development and decision making and help operationalize a customer-centric approach at USDA. For the farm loans program, CJM activities capture program touchpoints at each step of the customer’s journey to provide a research-based understanding of producers’ and loan officers’ pain points, points of delight, and moments of truth.</p>
            <p>These phases, emotions, and critical events are captured in a multi-dimensional diagram to provide a shared understanding of the current journey. The CJM process and findings are intended to help USDA prioritize its customer-facing activities and develop action plans to improve the customer experience.</p>
