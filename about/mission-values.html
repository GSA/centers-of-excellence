        <li><b>Collaborate for success</b> - The CoEs recruit the best and brightest from our customer’s workforce to co-lead modernization efforts and ensure success and longevity beyond CoE engagements.</li>
        <li><b>Rely on best practices</b> - We also partner with the private sector to implement the latest technology, utilize commercial practices, accelerate modernization and avoid common pitfalls.</li>
        <li><b>Centralize our resources</b> - By standing up the CoEs we strive to centralize and share the brightest talent, proven processes and acquisition vehicles to yield the best results across government.</li>

            <p>As a tactical approach to standing up the CoEs and proving their value, we wanted to find an agency collaborator that would go “all-in” with us - an enlightened, passionate agency partner that would work to advance in all five CoE areas. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue is focused on modernizing the way USDA works: focusing on becoming “the most efficient, most effective, and most customer-focused department in the federal government.”</p>
