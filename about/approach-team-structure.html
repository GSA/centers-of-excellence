    <h1>Our Approach &amp; Team Structure</h1>
    <h2>Phases</h2>
    <p class="intro">The CoEs partner with an Agency to co-create their modernization initiatives. The CoE teams will be embedded on-site, lead delivery, and require autonomy to drive results. 
</p>
    <h2 id="phases">Phases/h2>
    <p> The CoEs engage in a phased approach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Phase 0</b> - (3 Months) - Engagement scoping, Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) development, and funding identification</li>
        <li><b>Phase I</b> - (6 Months) - (6 Months) - A comprehensive department-wide discovery and planning effort to identify initial and high-impact modernization projects</li>
        <li><b>Phase II</b> (1-2 years) - Implementation of the agreed upon Phase I recommendations and build sustainment for continue modernization beyond CoE Phase II</li>
    
    <p>Accelerating modernization timelines require Agencies to reinforce priorities, be agile, and move fast. Below is an illustration of the activities through those phases. The Touchdown Team includes a GSA Site Lead, Center of Excellence Leads, and an Acquisition Lead</p>
