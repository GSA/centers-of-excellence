    <h1>Approach &amp; Team Structure</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">The CoEs partner with agencies to co-create their modernization initiatives. The CoE teams are embedded on-site, lead delivery, and require autonomy to drive results.</p>
    
    <h2>Objectives and Solution Competencies</h2>
    <p>The GSA Centers of Excellence (CoE) were established to accelerate IT modernization across government to:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Improve the public experience,</li>
        <li>Increase operational efficiency, and</li> 
        <li>Reduce legacy IT spending across the government.</li>
       </ul>
 
<p>To accomplish these objectives, the CoEs centralize top government tech talent, leverage private-sector best practices, and operate with a teaming mindset to collaborate across government departments and agencies.The CoE has teams focused on five functional areas: </p>
        <li><b>Cloud Adoption</b></li>
        <li><b>Contact Center</b></li>
        <li><b>Customer Experience</b></li>
        <li><b>Data Analytics</b></li>
        <li><b>Infrastructure Optimization</b></li>
    
    <h2>Delivery</h2>  
    <p> The CoEs engage in a phased approach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Phase 0</b> - (3 Months) - Engagement scoping, Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) development, and funding identification</li>
        <li><b>Phase I</b> - (6 Months) - A comprehensive department-wide discovery and planning effort to identify initial and high-impact modernization projects</li>
        <li><b>Phase II</b>-(1-2 years) - Implementation of the agreed upon Phase I recommendations and build sustainment for continue modernization beyond CoE Phase II</li>
