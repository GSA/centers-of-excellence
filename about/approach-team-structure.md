# About Us

The GSA Centers of Excellence (CoE) were established in 2017 as an accelerator of IT modernization across the government to improve the public experience and increase operational efficiency.

To drive sustainable modernization, the CoE centralizes top government tech talent and leverages private-sector resources and best practices. The organization operates as a consultancy with a teaming mindset to collaborate across government departments and agencies in six functional areas: 


- Artificial Intelligence
- Cloud Adoption
- Contact Center
- Customer Experience
- Data and Analytics
- Infrastructure Optimization

## Why Partner With Us

Government departments and agencies partner with CoE to co-create and accelerate their modernization initiatives. The CoE model focuses on bringing in the right people, at the right time, to drive sustainable outcomes.
