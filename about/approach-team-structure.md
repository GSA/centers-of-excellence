{: .intro}

## Objectives and Solution Competencies

The GSA Centers of Excellence (CoE) were established to accelerate IT modernization across government to improve the public experience and increase operational efficiency.
 
To accomplish these objectives, the CoE centralize top government tech talent, leverage private-sector best practices, and operate with a teaming mindset to collaborate across government departments and agencies. The CoE has teams focus on six functional areas:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Cloud Adoption
- Contact Center
- Customer Experience
- Data and Analytics
- Infrastructure Optimization

## Delivery

The CoE engage in a phased approach:

- **Phase 0**  - Engagement scoping, Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) development, and funding identification
- **Phase I** - A comprehensive department-wide discovery and planning effort to identify initial and high-impact modernization projects
- **Phase II** - Implementation of the agreed upon Phase I recommendations and build sustainment for continue modernization beyond CoE Phase II

## Team Structure

The teams are intentionally designed to have a unique blend of our customer detailees, GSA, and industry partners to deliver innovative solutions leveraging best practices and multiple perspectives. The success of the Centers of Excellence depends on our ability to identify and harness best practices within and outside of government.

To inform our approach and refine our processes, we regularly meet with agencies and industry partners to discuss their successes and challenges.
