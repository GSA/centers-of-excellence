	<h4 class="">Grow your Expertise in Areas that Matter Across Government</h4>
	<p><strong>Communities of practice</strong> are government-wide interest groups that provide opportunities for members to support, challenge and inspire one another. Cross-disciplinary and cross-agency by design, the goal of the communities is to expand your knowledge and practice in a given area of interest. You get what you give, so we encourage active participation through networking, discussions, live and virtual events and more.</p>
