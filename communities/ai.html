      <h2>About the AI Community of Practice</h2>
	<div class="community-about">
      	<p>The <strong>Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (AI CoP)</strong> serves as a pivotal network for government employees engaged in or interested in artificial intelligence, bringing together over 3,450 members from over 100 federal, state and local government agencies. Our community is dedicated to accelerating the responsible and thoughtful adoption of AI technologies across the government.</p>

		<p>Membership is open to all government employees and mission-supporting contractors with a .gov and .mil email address. As a member, you can participate in monthly community meetings, engage in specialized working groups, attend virtual training sessions and events, and connect with peers through our community forum. Our community provides a rich platform for knowledge-sharing and collaboration on AI policy, technology, standards, and programs.</p>

		<p>Established in 2020 in partnership with the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the AI CoP is instrumental in guiding the practical implementation of responsible AI within the federal government. We facilitate this through a variety of channels, including a monthly newsletter, diverse events, and active working groups.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Our vision:</strong> To embed the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning as a fully integrated and normalized practice within the U.S. Government, enhancing efficiency, innovation, and public service.
 		<p><strong>Our mission:</strong> To cultivate a comprehensive knowledge base and an inter-agency forum that empowers the federal workforce with best practices, tools, and resources for the ethical and effective deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

	<p>Community members can find past presentations & resources on our <a href="https://community.connect.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2172176006" target="_blank">community connect page</a>. </p>

   <h3>AI Training for Federal Employees</h3>
	<p>We are dedicated to empowering government employees with essential AI knowledge and skills. A key initiative in this endeavor is our recent collaboration with Stanford University for a tailored AI training series. This program, designed to cover both fundamental and advanced AI concepts, equips our workforce with the tools needed for responsible and effective AI implementation in government services. Through such targeted training, we ensure our employees are at the forefront of AI utilization, enhancing service delivery and mission achievement. Members can view the 2023 training series <a href="https://community.connect.gov/display/GSA/2023+Stanford+HAI+Training+Serieshere." target="_blank">here.</a></p>
   <h3>Applied AI Challenges</h3>
	<p>In 2023, the AI CoP organized two Applied AI Challenges focusing on <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=applied-ai-healthcare-challenge">Healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=appliedaichallengellms"> Large Language Models</a>, attracting over 140 applications. These challenges highlighted innovative AI solutions and showcased how industry-government collaboration can advance AI maturity within agencies.</p>
