      <h2>About the AI Community of Practice</h2>
	<div class="community-about">
      	<p>The <strong>Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (AI CoP)</strong> unites federal employees who are active or interested in AI policy, technology, standards, and programs to accelerate the thoughtful adoption of AI across the federal government. We are an active community of 1200 members across 60 federal agencies.</p>

We bring federal employees together through a monthly newsletter, events, and focus areas.</p>
