## About the 2024 Series
The AI Training Series is designed to provide you with practical knowledge and leading academic centers’ experience in artificial intelligence. It is divided into three distinct tracks — Acquisition, Technical, and Leadership and Policy — each containing multiple AI-related sessions to provide valuable information for a wide range of roles and responsibilities within the government workforce. All government employees may attend any sessions in any track at no cost. No prior expertise is required to attend. All training sessions will be conducted as a ZoomGov Webinar, and participants will register through Zoom. Live captioning will be available to all participants. Recordings will be made available after the sessions to those not able to attend live.  

The goals of the training series are to:
* Educate the government workforce on the basics and current landscape of AI as it relates to Acquisition, Technology, and Leadership and Policy
* Provide access to academic AI leaders for all government employees
* Encourage responsible use of AI across the government to improve operations

Training is open to ALL government employees. This training fulfills the mandates included in the [AI Training Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ207/PLAW-117publ207.pdf) and [Responsible AI EO 13960](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/08/2020-27065/promoting-the-use-of-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-federal-government).
