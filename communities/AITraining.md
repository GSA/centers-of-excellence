## About the 2024 Series
The AI Training Series is designed to provide you with practical knowledge and leading academic centers’ experience in artificial intelligence. It is divided into three distinct tracks — Acquisition, Technical, and Leadership — each containing multiple AI-related sessions to provide valuable information for a wide range of roles and responsibilities within the government workforce. All government employees may attend any sessions in any track at no cost. No prior expertise is required to attend. All training sessions will be conducted as a ZoomGov Webinar, and participants will register through Zoom. Live captioning will be available to all participants. Recordings will be made available after the sessions to those not able to attend live.  

The goals of the training series are to:
* Educate the government workforce on the basics and current landscape of AI as it relates to Acquisition, Technology, and Leadership
* Provide access to academic AI leaders for all government employees
* Encourage responsible use of AI across the government to improve operations
The training is open to ALL government employees. This training fulfills the mandates included in the [AI Training Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ207/PLAW-117publ207.pdf) and [Responsible AI EO 13960](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/08/2020-27065/promoting-the-use-of-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-federal-government). 

 
## Schedules and Courses

*Coming Soon: Full schedules and course descriptions will be published soon, pending partner aproval.*

* **Acquisition:** In partnership with The George Washington University Law School, the Acquisition Track focuses on equipping government employees with knowledge to effectively procure and manage AI technologies. Participants will encounter the fundamentals of procuring government AI solutions, better understand the potential of AI in public service, and consider current challenges in risk management and ethics. Additionally, they will learn to craft an approach to AI acquisition, gain critical insights for safeguarding national security, and understand guidelines for managing sensitive information responsibly. GW Law is the academic birthplace of the study of government procurement law with the leading government contracts law program and a mission to provide a richer understanding of how procurement systems operate.
* **Technical:** In collaboration with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), the Technical Track aims to equip federal employees with the knowledge to understand, implement, and govern AI technologies. These sessions break down complex AI concepts into digestible lessons, grounded in multidisciplinary research. Participants will learn about human-centered AI development, implementation, and application, including topics on the technical underpinnings of foundation models, examples of risks, privacy and security, as well as techniques that AI developers can use to evaluate and mitigate risks. The mission of HAI is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.
* **Leadership:** In partnership with the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, the Leadership Track aims to empower government leaders with the insights and strategies necessary to guide AI initiatives within their organizations and to better understand and improve the relationship between technology and society. This track covers AI policy development, ethical leadership, and strategic planning. The Center for Information Technology Policy is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, interdisciplinary hub where researchers study the impact of digital technologies on society for the good of society.
