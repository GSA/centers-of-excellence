## About the 2024 Series
The AI Training Series is designed to provide you with practical knowledge and leading academic centers’ experience in artificial intelligence. It is divided into three distinct tracks — Acquisition, Technical, and Leadership and Policy — each containing multiple AI-related sessions to provide valuable information for a wide range of roles and responsibilities within the government workforce. All government employees may attend any sessions in any track at no cost. No prior expertise is required to attend. All training sessions will be conducted as a ZoomGov Webinar, and participants will register through Zoom. Live captioning will be available to all participants. Recordings will be made available after the sessions to those not able to attend live.  

The goals of the training series are to:
* Educate the government workforce on the basics and current landscape of AI as it relates to Acquisition, Technology, and Leadership and Policy
* Provide access to academic AI leaders for all government employees
* Encourage responsible use of AI across the government to improve operations
The training is open to ALL government employees. This training fulfills the mandates included in the [AI Training Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ207/PLAW-117publ207.pdf) and [Responsible AI EO 13960](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/08/2020-27065/promoting-the-use-of-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-federal-government). 

 
## Schedules and Courses

### Acquisition
In partnership with The George Washington University Law School, the Acquisition Track focuses on equipping government employees with knowledge to effectively procure and manage AI technologies. Participants will encounter the fundamentals of procuring government AI solutions, better understand the potential of AI in public service, and consider current challenges in risk management and ethics. Additionally, they will learn to craft an approach to AI acquisition, gain critical insights for safeguarding national security, and understand guidelines for managing sensitive information responsibly. GW Law is the academic birthplace of the study of government procurement law with the leading government contracts law program and a mission to provide a richer understanding of how procurement systems operate.

**Buying AI: Government Contracts 101** | Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2024, 12-1pm EST | This session will focus on special considerations for a long-term AI acquisition strategy, such as ensuring explainability, how AI could harm the federal government and U.S. citizens, as well as statutory and policy compliance, including meeting U.S. government technical best practices. 
**How Does AI Benefit the Federal Government?** | Wednesday Sept. 11, 2024, 12-1pm EST | AI acquisitions to advance national security agency missions and programs or those that enhance tech stacks require special considerations of existing and new requirements. This session will survey the landscape and outline key considerations to make sound decisions.
**Risk Management & Ethics** | Monday, Sept. 16, 2024, 12-1pm EST | An overview of the ethical considerations and risk mitigation measures essential to responsible AI acquisition.
**Developing a Long-Term AI Acquisition Strategy** | Sept. 17, 2024, 12-1pm EST | This session will focus on special considerations for a long-term AI acquisition strategy, such as ensuring explainability, how AI could harm the federal government and U.S. citizens, as well as statutory and policy compliance, including meeting U.S. government technical best practices. 
**National Security AI Acquisitions** | Sept. 19, 2024, 12-1pm EST | AI acquisitions to advance national security agency missions and programs or those that enhance tech stacks require special considerations of existing and new requirements. This session will survey the landscape and outline key considerations to make sound decisions.
**Data Privacy Considerations** | Sept. 24, 1-2pm EST | An overview of the general and AI procurement-specific data privacy considerations that are crucial to an effective and compliant procurement strategy, including mitigating the risks of harms associated with AI.
**Compliance with AI-Related Regulations** | Sept. 25,12-1pm EST | The acquisition of AI is governed by a myriad regulatory requirements. This session will help attendees identify and understand the key regulations that govern the purchase of this technology.

### Technical
In collaboration with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), the Technical Track aims to equip federal employees with the knowledge to understand, implement, and govern AI technologies. These sessions break down complex AI concepts into digestible lessons, grounded in multidisciplinary research. Participants will learn about human-centered AI development, implementation, and application, including topics on the technical underpinnings of foundation models, examples of risks, privacy and security, as well as techniques that AI developers can use to evaluate and mitigate risks. The mission of HAI is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

**Navigating the AI Landscape:** Tuesday, October 1, 2024 | 12-1pm EST

**Training Cost-Effective Large Language Models** | Thursday, October 23, 2024 | 12-1pm EST
The cost of training large language models (LLM) is currently quite high with top of the line models costing billions of dollars to train. However, are costs expected to always remain that high? This course looks into the resources required to train LLMs and what could be done to make training them more cost effective. 



### Leadership and Policy
In partnership with the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, the Leadership and Policy Track aims to empower government leaders with the insights and strategies necessary to guide AI initiatives within their organizations and to better understand and improve the relationship between technology and society. This track covers AI policy development, ethical leadership, and strategic planning. The Center for Information Technology Policy is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, interdisciplinary hub where researchers study the impact of digital technologies on society for the good of society.
