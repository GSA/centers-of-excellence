## Welcome to the AI Training Series for Government Employees
Enhance your skills and knowledge of the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI)..
{: .intro} 

Our comprehensive training series is designed to inform and educate government employees at all levels, offering specialized tracks to meet the diverse needs of the government workforce. The AI CoP is conducting this AI Training in partnership with Stanford HAI, GWU Law School, Princeton CITP, Wilson Center, GSA OGP, and OMB OFCIO.  
  
## About the 2024 Series
The AI Training Series is designed to provide you with practical knowledge and leading academic centers’ experience in artificial intelligence. It is divided into three distinct tracks - Acquisition, Technical, and Leadership - each containing multiple AI-related sessions to provide valuable information for a wide range of roles and responsibilities within the government workforce. All government employees may attend any sessions in any track. All training sessions will be conducted as a ZoomGov Webinar, and participants will register through Zoom. Recordings will be made available after the sessions to those not able to attend live. 

The goals of the training series are to:
* Educate the government workforce on the basics and current landscape of AI as it relates to Acquisition, Technology, and Leadership.
* Provide access to academic AI leaders for all government employees.
* Encourage responsible use of AI across the government to improve operations
The training is open to ALL government employees. This training fulfills the mandates included in the AI Training Act and Responsible AI EO 13960.

### Acquisition Track
In Partnership with The George Washington University Law School, the Acquisition Track focuses on equipping government employees with knowledge to effectively procure and manage AI technologies. Participants will encounter the fundamentals of procuring government AI solutions, better understand the potential of AI in public service, and consider current challenges in risk management and ethics. Additionally, they will learn to craft an approach to AI acquisition, gain critical insights for safeguarding national security, and understand guidelines for managing sensitive information responsibly.

### Technical Track
In partnership with Stanford University’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institute (HAI), the Technical Track is designed for government employees with a background in technology and aims to deepen their understanding of AI algorithms, data science, and implementation strategies. Stanford HAI promotes human-centered uses of AI, and strives to ensure that humanity equitably benefits from the technology.

### Leadership Track
In partnership with the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, the Leadership Track aims to empower government leaders with the insights and strategies necessary to guide AI initiatives within their organizations and to better understand and improve the relationship between technology and society. This track covers AI policy development, ethical leadership, and strategic planning. The Center for Information Technology Policy is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, interdisciplinary hub where researchers study the impact of digital technologies on society for the good of society.
