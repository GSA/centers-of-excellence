## About the Trainings

### Are these different from the AI Training sessions from September 2023? 
Yes, these sessions are entirely new and different from last yearâ€™s training series with original content and new instructors in expanded knowledge areas. 

### Do you need previous knowledge of AI to attend these trainings?
No prior experience or technical knowledge is required to attend these training sessions. 

### Are there courses for non-technical professionals?
Yes! The 2024 AI Training Series offers a Leadership and Policy knowledge track containing sessions that focus on effectively leading and managing AI-enabled teams, as well as enhancing business decision-making through AI technologies, without a technical focus. The Acquisitions knowledge track provides information on effectively procuring and managing AI technologies. The Technical knowledge track will explore more detailed aspects of AI technology like building foundation models and utilizing generative AI. However, no technical expertise is required to participate in any of the AI training series sessions in any of the tracks. 

### What are the differences between the tracks?
Each track has a different focus and intended audience. The Acquisition Track focuses on equipping government employees with knowledge to effectively procure and manage AI technologies. The Technical Track aims to equip federal employees with the knowledge to understand, implement, and govern AI technologies. The sessions will break down complex AI concepts into digestible lessons about human-centered AI development, implementation, and application, including topics on the technical underpinnings of foundational models as well as techniques that AI developers can use to evaluate and mitigate risks. The Leadership and Policy Track aims to empower government leaders with the insights and strategies necessary to guide AI initiatives within their organizations and to better understand and improve the relationship between technology and society.
