In order to ensure more efficient and standard assignment of job classifications, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) used machine learning (ML) to enable automated code assignment, a process they call “autocoding.”
{: .intro }

BLS quantifies and analyzes data associated with the millions of American workers who are injured on the job. Information about worker injuries and illnesses is written as short narratives in OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) logs and Worker’s Compensation reports. Each year the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects several hundred thousand of these through the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. These narratives need to be classified (i.e., coded) to enable the quantitative analysis of the characteristics of workplace incidents. 

Prior to automation, the narratives were entirely coded by hand, requiring an estimated 25,000 hours of labor to complete the initial coding, and more to find and correct errors. Despite the expertise of the analysts, it is likely that some errors were not caught. The BLS wanted to improve both the efficiency and the quality of the coding.

In 2018, after trying several different approaches, BLS switched to deep neural networks with character-level convolutional word embeddings and long-term-short-term (LSTM) recurrent layers implemented in Keras and Tensorflow. By 2019 BLS was using machine learning to assign approximately 85 percent of codes.

## Background
Prior to 2014, BLS relied entirely on staff to read and code injury narratives collected through the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. BLS collects approximately 300,000 such narratives each year, and assigns six codes to each to enable aggregate analysis. Ensuring consistent manual coding is challenging, time and labor intensive, and open to error and inconsistency. 

Quantitative analysis of injury narratives can highlight important workplace safety issues, but requires that the reports be consistently coded. **By using autocoding, BLS ensures more consistent and accurate classification of the data while freeing up analysts for other important tasks such as better data collection and review.**

## Responsible AI management
BLS has considered issues associated with responsible AI. The model does not use demographic attributes to assign codes and the model outputs do not directly impact individuals. BLS also publicly shares the code and methodology used to train the model and regularly engages with external stakeholder groups to collect feedback and share updates on the project’s development. 

## Where we go from here
Now that the model has been developed, many people and organizations are interested in using it, including state labor and employment agencies, as well as researchers. However, the model has been trained on protected information. BLS is researching whether there is a way to share  trained models without compromising protected information. If this proves feasible it could eventually allow the sharing of trained models with the public. BLS also continues to monitor advances in natural language processing in search of additional improvements.
