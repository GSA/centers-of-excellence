title: "Using deep learning to recognize peptide antimicrobial activity in proteins"
---
The Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch in the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has used deep neural networks (DNN) to identify antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
{: .intro }

As resistance to antibiotics becomes an ever-larger health threat, researchers need to identify new methods for treating bacterial infection. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), part of the body’s natural immune defense, are a promising method. 

Natural antimicrobial peptides have been an active area of research and seem to have a lowered likelihood of forming resistance to drugs compared to conventional drugs. Identifying the most promising AMPs has been challenging, and previous research has shown the benefits of using machine learning to identify potential candidates. By using a deep neural network (DNN) classifier, NIAID’s approach achieves better AMP recognition compared to existing methods.

## Background
With bacterial resistance a serious concern for both humans and livestock, drugs are losing their sensitivity to pathogens and, therefore, their effectiveness in treating disease. Researchers are looking for alternative treatments and are investigating the potential of AMPs, which are natural components of immune defense. **As testing for AMPs is expensive, researchers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) for fast and efficient methods to screen large peptide libraries to quickly identify those with a higher likelihood of antimicrobial activity.**

By screening AMPs to identify those showing antimicrobial activity, researchers can focus their work and drug development in the most promising areas. This will lead, potentially, to more productive research with faster treatment development. In addition, NIAID has made their training and testing dataset and AI model available to the research community on [AMP Scanner](https://www.dveltri.com/ascan/), so that they can conduct systematic virtual screenings of peptide libraries to identify promising peptides for further research.

## Where we go from here
 - Models are retrained and updated once a year to incorporate new AMPs that have been added to the source database.
 - More advanced deep learning models may be considered in the future for more accurate prediction. These models may be made available in other existing NIAID AMP resources such as the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP).
