Using artificial intelligence (AI), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) hopes to be able to provide robust information on the surface of Mars to scientists to help them learn about the planet and plan daily missions.
{: .intro }

Exploring the surface of Mars is critical to the next stage of NASA’s mission. However, Mars is far away and the processing and communication capabilities of unmanned vehicles such as the rover are limited. These limits impact both the information sent back to Earth and the ability of the scientists on Earth to confidently plan for excursions.

One of the key missions of a Mars Rover, such as the Mars 2020 rover Perseverance that was sent in July 2020 and touched down in February 2021, is to map the terrain on Mars. To do this, scientists need to assess the landscape, taking thousands of pictures as they move around the surface. But to make sense of the images, the rover has to transmit them back to Earth, where scientists can evaluate them and assess, based on what happened today, how the Rover should respond tomorrow.

AI is being used to make the rover more intelligent, more productive, and safer. This initiative is part of the Machine Learning-based Analytics for Autonomous Rover Systems (MAARS) program.

## Background
Because it takes a long time for communications to travel between Earth and Mars (Earth sends a request, and eight minutes later they receive a response), the rover can send approximately 200 images a day for the scientists to assess.

But if the rover can send text messages — basically descriptions of the surface of Mars, instead of images — it can transmit much more detailed information, more frequently. In addition, if the rover could analyze the descriptions, it could decide where to go — and where not to go — based on its assessment of the descriptive text. This would allow the rover to move toward autonomous exploration of Mars. Accessing descriptions of two paths, the rover could assess that one is rock and the other sand, and that the sand path would require more energy to cross. The rover can make a determination to take the most energy efficient path, in what NASA calls “energy-optimal auto navigation.”

The rover would, essentially, keep a journal: there’s a boulder over here, scrabble from a former water bed over there. The Rover could send back a million images, captured in descriptive text. NASA calls this “drive by science.”

## Responsible AI
JPL gives a lot of thought to responsible AI, and in the case of this initiative, it is specifically around responsible computer vision as it relates to geology. They spend a lot of time validating the labeling and predictions. 

While using computer vision to map the geology of Mars is not as inherently controversial as using computer vision on humans, there are considerations, including the potential to map and inappropriately label something that causes great concern. 

## Where we go from here
The JPL is still in the process of testing and piloting this AI, but is already looking forward to operationalizing it. There aren’t turnkey solutions today, and operationalizing ML is still very manual. There’s a lot of work to do to make this work on a larger scale. 

At the same time, they are excited about the opportunity with the Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) that makes training models more efficient by reducing the amount of labeled data required.
