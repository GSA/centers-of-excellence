Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the computational techniques that simulate human cognitive capabilities. AI will transform most, if not every aspect of humanity, which presents a range of challenges and opportunities. 
{: .intro }

AI has already revolutionized the business world. Its application across the federal government is fundamentally changing the way agencies meet their mission. **The U.S. government must embrace these opportunities head-on to remain on the leading edge and stay competitive.**

This AI Use Case Abstracts is intended to help government decision makers clearly see what AI means for their agencies and how to invest and build AI capabilities.

Because AI is such a broad term to describe new and emerging applications, we’ve broken the AI Use Case Abstracts into different chapters. At this time, the Guide does not include technical sections.
