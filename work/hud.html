      <p>The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. Through the CoE initiative, HUD is examining its technology infrastructure and operating procedures to identify needed upgrades and opportunities for improvement. These changes will help the agency in its goal to strengthen the housing market for people at every income level and to improve quality of life for current and future HUD program participants. The CoE work began in October 2018 and is currently on Phase 1.</p>

                <h3 id="key accomplishments phase 1">Key Accomplishments Phase 1</h3>

           <p>The Cloud Adoption COE discovered a need for establishing a HUD Forms-as-a-Service enterprise capability for the common benefit of all HUD programs. As such, the team has been conducting prototyping activities with various program areas (PD&R/PIH and FHA) and conducting market research, 
               vendor demonstrations, and use case identification / requirements development </p>
            <p>Additionally, the Cloud COE has also been focused on establishing the Intelligent Data Extraction enterprise capability to implement an artificial intelligence-powered OCR/ICR solution to capture and extract 
              handwritten and machine print data and make it available for robotic process automation and data analytics. The team has been working on proof-of-concept activities with a commercial vendor for initial set of use cases.</p>

        <h3 id="key accomplishments phase 1">Key Accomplishments Phase 1</h3>

            <p>The Contact Center COE partnered with HUD to assess current state contact center operations. The team conducted surveys, interviews, site visits, “mystery shopping” test calls, technology demos, 
               and artifacts review. Drawing on this data, the team inventoried all inquiry resolution channels, analyzed the customer experience, assessed the maturity of each contact center, and estimated and benchmarked 
               current state costs.</p>

           <p>The CX CoE team completed the Discovery sprint and provided the following work products to inform the implementation phase:</p>
  
        <ul>
            <li>Opportunity/Impact Assessment model which will be used as the backlog for future CX projects</li>
            <li>Interim Report of Findings of Internal Key Takeaways reflecting the discovery research</li>
            <li>An Affordable Housing for Seniors Customer Journey Map, which will serve as the jumping off point for agency-wide ideation and solutions</li>
            <li>Ideal State Vision as the framework for a more ideal journey to affordable housing, with report</li>
            <li>Draft charter for a new Office of Customer Experience</li>

        </ul>

      <h3 id="key accomplishments phase 1">Key Accomplishments Phase 1</h3>
        
      <p> The Data Analytics CoE assessed HUD’s people, processes, and technologies to understand how data is collected, managed and transformed into insights for decision makers. 
          As a result, a theory of change model was developed to create a comprehensive roadmap to data and analytics maturity. As part of this, the CoE accelerated ongoing efforts to implement 
          enterprise-wide data governance, and helped initiate the process for instituting a formal, fully-funded Chief Data Officer (CDO) position.</p>
          <p>Lastly, a series of scalable dashboard and advanced analytics prototypes were developed that help demonstrate the value of achieving a more mature state, including the resultant benefits 
          of improved decision making and cost savings. Core Discovery work products delivered included current and future state assessment, data governance charter and roadmap, PIH financial dashboard prototype, Single Family Housing post-payment 
          claims advanced analytics protype, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Key Performance Indicators (KPI) dashboard prototypes.</p>
