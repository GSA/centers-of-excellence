           <p>The Cloud Adoption COE discovered a need for establishing a HUD Forms-as-a-Service enterprise capability for the common benefit of all HUD programs. As such, the team has been conducting prototyping activities with various program areas (PD&R/PIH and FHA) and conducting market research, 
              vendor demonstrations, and use case identification / requirements development. Additionally, the Cloud COE has also been focused on establishing the Intelligent Data Extraction enterprise capability to implement an artificial intelligence-powered OCR/ICR solution to capture and extract 
              handwritten and machine print data and make it available for robotic process automation and data analytics. The team has been working on proof-of-concept activities with a commercial vendor for initial set of use cases.</p>

           <ul>
            <li>REE - Established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for REE mission area that align with the USDA strategic plan by conducting several workshops with the REE team. As a part of this effort, REE agency level performance indicators were assessed and evaluated to see where improvements can be made. The improved metrics have been approved by the Deputy Secretary and will be implemented in Phase II. Additionally, Rural Development mission area is interested in developing strategic plan KPIs for RD based on the same process in Phase II. (July -August 2018)</li>
            <li>FS - Developed working prototypes for Forest Service describing Timber Sale information over time. In addition to tracking timber sales information, these dashboards can be used to forecast expected progress as well as the impact of process/technology improvements on timber sales.(August- September 2018)</li>
            <li>Analyzed customer feedback from citizens across the U.S. gathered through the “Tell Sonny” initiative and created user friendly visualizations to inform USDA. The visualizations are updated daily and are triaged to respective USDA agencies for further action. (April 2018)</li>
            <li>Evaluated USDA mission area strategic KPIs to assess alignment with USDA strategic plan. Currently working on expanding it to include additional agency level KPIs. (May-August 2018)</li>
            <li>Created a prototype OMB A-11 feedback mechanism and worked with mission areas including FPAC to socialize requirements and support implementation. (July-August 2018)</li>
            <li>Assessed and evaluated needs around various Voice of Customer (VoC) channels including Tell Sonny, Social Media and Web Analytics to evaluate where USDA can develop data driven solutions to understand customer sentiment. As a part of this effort, various working visualization prototypes were developed to reflect customer feedback that can be expanded to reflect a holistic view of USDA Voice of Customer in Phase II. (July-September 2018)</li>
