              <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
 
           <p>As a tactical approach to standing up the Centers of Excellence (CoE) and proving their value, we found an agency collaborator that would go “all-in” with us - an enlightened, passionate agency partner that would work to advance in all five CoE areas. Working together, USDA and the CoE are modernizing IT across the department to execute the Secretary Sonny Perdue's vision of being data driven and a leader in customer service and experience, not just across the government, but across industry as well.</p> 
        <p>The CoE began Phase 1 Discovery Work at USDA in April 2018, and their Phase II implementation activities in October 2018.</p>

           <ul>
            <li>REE - Established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for REE mission area that align with the USDA strategic plan by conducting several workshops with the REE team. As a part of this effort, REE agency level performance indicators were assessed and evaluated to see where improvements can be made. The improved metrics have been approved by the Deputy Secretary and will be implemented in Phase II. Additionally, Rural Development mission area is interested in developing strategic plan KPIs for RD based on the same process in Phase II. </li>
            <li>FS - Developed working prototypes for Forest Service describing Timber Sale information over time. In addition to tracking timber sales information, these dashboards can be used to forecast expected progress as well as the impact of process/technology improvements on timber sales.</li>
            <li>Analyzed customer feedback from citizens across the U.S. gathered through the “Tell Sonny” initiative and created user friendly visualizations to inform USDA. The visualizations are updated daily and are triaged to respective USDA agencies for further action. </li>
            <li>Evaluated USDA mission area strategic KPIs to assess alignment with USDA strategic plan. Currently working on expanding it to include additional agency level KPIs. </li>
            <li>Created a prototype OMB A-11 feedback mechanism and worked with mission areas including FPAC to socialize requirements and support implementation.</li>
            <li>Assessed and evaluated needs around various Voice of Customer (VoC) channels including Tell Sonny, Social Media and Web Analytics to evaluate where USDA can develop data driven solutions to understand customer sentiment. As a part of this effort, various working visualization prototypes were developed to reflect customer feedback that can be expanded to reflect a holistic view of USDA Voice of Customer in Phase II. </li>
