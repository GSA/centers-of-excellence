            <p>As a tactical approach to standing up the CoE and proving their value, we wanted to find an agency collaborator that would go “all-in” with us - an enlightened, passionate agency partner that would work to advance in all five CoE areas. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue is focused on modernizing the way USDA works: focusing on becoming “the most efficient, most effective, and most customer-focused department in the federal government.”</p>
