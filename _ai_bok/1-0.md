This guide is for agency senior leaders and decision makers. We specifically target senior agency leadership; Chief Information, Data and Technology Officers; Chief Financial and Procurement Officers; program directors; and agency mission leaders. 
{: .intro }

This guide gives leaders enough information to make the right AI investments. You donâ€™t need to be technically proficient in AI to use this guide. Non-technical decision makers who must determine the level of investment required, and where and how those investments will be deployed, can use this guide. 

Other users could be directors and managers of AI program offices. **They might delegate management of AI projects to other managers who will oversee key decisions on whether to build or acquire AI tools, techniques and algorithms, and solicit expertise from those in the agency with more advanced AI expertise, if available.**
