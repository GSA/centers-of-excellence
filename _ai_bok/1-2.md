{: .intro }

One of AI’s challenges is that it’s a multi-disciplinary domain where even basic definitions are tricky. Here, we will focus on four terms and the relationship among them: AI, machine learning, and data science. 

## Artificial intelligence (AI)

AI combines three disciplines—math, computer science, and cognitive science—to mimic human behavior through various technologies. 
{: .intro }
Many, if not most, of the AI in place today is task-specific, or narrow AI. This is an important distinction as many in the AI space think of AI as the general ability to reason, think and perceive over a variety of. This is known as general AI which, at this point, is not technically possible.

This technology is rapidly evolving, and neither the scientific community nor industry agree on a common definition. 

Some common definitions of AI include:
- A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.
- Advanced statistical and analytical methods such as machine learning and artificial neural networks, especially deep learning.
- A computer system able to perform specific tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

It is important to keep in mind that the definition of AI is still evolving and that achievements in the field today have been in task-specific AI, as opposed to general intelligence AI like humans. AI capabilities are rapidly evolving, and neither the scientific community nor industry agree on a common definition of these technologies. In this guide, we will use the definition of AI from the [National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr5515/BILLS-115hr5515enr.pdf), which is also referenced in the [Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/14/2019-02544/maintaining-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence).

The term “artificial intelligence'' includes the following:
- Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets.
- An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action.
- An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks.
- A set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed to approximate a cognitive task.
- An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision making, and acting.
 

## Data Science

Data science is the practice and methodology of implementing analytics or machine learning techniques, with subject matter expertise, to provide insights that lead to actions. 
{: .intro }

Data science is a broad field that covers a broad range of analytics and computer science techniques. This field—and the various professions that perform data science—-are a critical component to building AI solutions. 

In practice, data science is a cross-functional discipline that combines elements of computer science, mathematics, statistics, and subject-matter expertise. The goal of data science is to produce data-driven insights and processes that can help solve business, operational, and strategic problems for different kinds of organizations. This is often, though not always, achieved using machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities.

Throughout these modules, we will frequently refer to data science and data science teams. These are the teams who support the many data and AI efforts underway in government agencies.

Read more about how data science fits into the broader government AI ecosystem in the modules that discuss Integrated Product Teams (IPT) and Developing the AI workforce.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning (ML) refers to the field and practice of using algorithms that are able to “learn” by extracting patterns from a large body of data.
{: .intro }

This contrasts to traditional rule-based algorithms. The process of building a machine learning model is, by nature, an iterative approach to problem solving. ML has an adaptive approach that looks over a large body of all possible outcomes and chooses the result that best satisfies its objective function.  

Though different forms of ML have existed for years, recent advancements in technology provide the underlying capabilities that have enabled ML to become as promising as it is today. Increased computing capacity (especially elastic computing infrastructure in the cloud), large-scale labelled data sets, and widely distributed open-source ML software frameworks and codes propelled the development of ML models. With these advancements, the accuracy of ML prediction and the number of problems ML can address have dramatically increased in the past decade. 

There are three high-level categories of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each has its own mathematical backbone, and each has its own unique areas of application. Occasionally in more complex workflows, they may be combined. 

**Supervised learning** is the most widely adopted ML method, given its clear learning goal and close resemblance to human behavior. A Supervised learning algorithm learns a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. The example output is often referred to as “label”, which can be either created manually or taken from outcomes of historical data, such as a picture of a cat with an associated “cat” label.

Supervised learning is widely used in object recognition for self-driving cars and clinical decision support. Mostly recently, it leads to much improved experience in the state-of-the-art chatbots that have been trained to identify a range of topics (the “label”) by understanding human language as input (a question or comment).

**Unsupervised learning** is often used in data exploration before a learning goal is established. Unlike the training and testing steps in supervised learning, unsupervised learning tends to emphasize the goodness-of-fit (the extent to which observed data match the values expected) of the data. Analysts often independently experiment with multiple unsupervised learning methods or the same method but with different parameters, and evaluate the goodness-of-fit through a mathematical cost function or visualization techniques. 

![Unsupervised Learning](../images/unsupervised-learning.png)

Unsupervised learning is widely used in fraud detection to segment outlier behavior patterns. 

**Reinforcement learning** makes discrete sequential decisions about the overall learning space. A reinforcement learning agent receives an incremental reward or punishment each time it makes a decision. This reward or punishment acts in many ways like a label. The next decision is based on all the accumulated knowledge developed through prior decisions, and the goal is to maximize the accumulated rewards.

~~Below is an illustration of a particular state in a navigation problem solved using reinforcement learning.~~

![Reinforced Learning](../images/reinforced-learning.png)

~~The above figure illustrates how a robot agent learns from the environment and applies the knowledge in future navigation steps.~~

Reinforcement learning is commonly used in navigation use cases and to play games like chess or Go. 

Another example is when a vacuuming robot decides whether it should enter a new room to collect more trash or return to the battery charging dock. The robot decides based on the current battery charge level and how quickly it has been able to find the charging dock in the past.

>  **Supervised learning** is the most widely adopted method to address agencies' mission business.
>
>  **Unsupervised learning and descriptive analytics** are similar, except for the added automated discovery of subgroups and high-dimensional data structure with the help of advanced statistical techniques.
>
>  **Reinforcement learning** tends to be employed for navigation-specific use cases.  
>
>  AI solutions use one, or in some cases several, of these ML techniques.

## Myths about Artificial Intelligence	

Though AI is a powerful technology already providing deep insight and business value, it is not magic. Understanding AI’s limitations will help you choose realistic and attainable AI projects. Below are some common myths about AI and pitfalls to avoid when evaluating it as a potential tool.

### Myth about AI:
{: .ai-myth-header }
#### AI will replace humans in the workplace.
{: .ai-myth }
##### Reality: 
{: .ai-reality-header }

AI is more likely to replace tasks within a job, not the entire job itself. Almost all present-day AI systems perform specific tasks rather than entire jobs. The purpose of AI and automation is to make low-value tasks faster and easier, thus freeing up people to focus on high-value work that requires human creativity and critical thinking. Historically, automation has created more jobs than it replaces. **AI will mostly replace tasks, not jobs. It is more appropriate to think in terms of human-machine teams where each does the tasks for which it is best-suited. Many forecasts predict that new jobs will be created, i.e. people are and will continue to be needed for certain tasks and jobs.** 

### Myth about AI:
{: .ai-myth-header }
#### AI can think like a human and learn on its own.
{: .ai-myth }
##### Reality: 
{: .ai-reality-header }

AI uses mathematical models and finite computing power to process information. Though some AI techniques might use “neural nets,”  these algorithms only remotely resemble human biology. **Their outputs are still entirely based on data and rules prepared by humans.**

### Myth about AI:
{: .ai-myth-header }
#### AI is always more objective than humans.
{: .ai-myth }
##### Reality: 
{: .ai-reality-header }

AI applications are a product of data and algorithms combined into   models. Data is collected, prepared, and managed by humans. Combining it with algorithms may still produce unfair and biased results. Machines and humans have different strengths and limitations. Humans are good at general tasks and big-picture thinking. Machines are good at doing specific tasks precisely. **Well-calibrated human plus machine combinations are almost always superior in performance to a human alone or a machine alone.** 

### Myth about AI:
{: .ai-myth-header }
#### You can just buy AI solutions that will work across the board.
{: .ai-myth }
##### Reality: 
{: .ai-reality-header }

Identifying AI use cases and the data required for them can be specific and localized. Further, the nature of algorithms and model training can require varying degrees of customization as the data is aggregated, cleansed, assimilated, and the outcomes are generated. Barriers to consider beyond technology include organizational culture, appetite for risk, the acquisition process, and agency willingness to experiment. **Buy vs. build decisions require careful assessment.** 

### Myth about AI:
{: .ai-myth-header }
#### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is just around the corner.
{: .ai-myth }
##### Reality: 
{: .ai-reality-header }

Artificial General Intelligence refers to AI that achieves general human-level intelligence. For most systems, there is a trade-off between performance and generality. An algorithm can be trained to perform one specific task really well, but not every possible task. Whether AGI takes decades or centuries to achieve, it’s more complex than most imagine. The more tasks we want a single machine to perform, the weaker its general performance becomes.


### Myth about AI:
{: .ai-myth-header }
#### A large team of data scientists is required to implement an AI project.
{: .ai-myth }
##### Reality: 
{: .ai-reality-header }

**Developing AI solutions might require only a couple of person-weeks, or it could take years with a large team. It all depends on the nature of the objective, data, required technical infrastructure, and integration into the existing environment.** Depending on the maturity of the AI applications related to the specific problem of interest to your agency, the level of data science involvement can vary significantly. 
- Some applications, such as voice recognition, can be deployed from commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) products. 
- Some AI applications require training of an existing algorithm using agency-specific data, needing a small data science team.  
- Some AI applications are still in the research and development stage. A relatively large data science team is needed to explore the data characteristics and identify the suited AI method to solve the problem.
