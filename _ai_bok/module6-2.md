Organizational maturity areas represent the capacity to embed AI capabilities across the organization. 
{: .intro }

The first approach is influenced by the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) system of evaluating organizational maturity. This particular top-down method helps you evaluate organizations. The top-down view in the table below is based on CMMI levels 1-5.

The second approach is user-centric. It uses the CMMI system as an industry standard for evaluating organizational maturity. This bottom-up view is synthesized from CoE engagements with federal agency partners, market research, case study evaluation, and lessons learned. 

Senior leaders and executives generally evaluate organizational maturity from a top-down view. 

Program and mission managers focus on delivery. The bottom-up view reflects their perspective. AI investment decision makers can analyze activities from a top-down, bottom up, or dual-view perspective. These levels correspond to the top markers on the AI CMM table.


## Top-Down View
- **Initial/Ad Hoc:** Process is unpredictable, poorly controlled, and unmanaged.
- **Repeatable:** Process is documented and steps are repeatable with consistent results. Often reactionary.
- **Defined:** Documented, standardized processes that are improved over time.
- **Managed:** Activities are effectively measured, and meeting objectives are based on active management and evidence-based outcomes.
- **Optimized:** Continuous performance improvement of activities through incremental and innovative improvements. 


## Bottom-Up View
- **Individual:** No organizational team structure around activities.  Self-organized and executed.
- **Team Project:** A dedicated, functional team organized around process activities. Organized by skill set or mission.
- **Program:** Group of related projects managed in a coordinated way. Introduction of structured program management.
- **Portfolio:** Collection of projects, programs, and other operations that achieve strategic objectives.
- **Enterprise:** Operational activities and resources are organized around enterprise strategy and business goals.
